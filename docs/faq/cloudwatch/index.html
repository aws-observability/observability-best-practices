<p><strong>Why should I choose Amazon CloudWatch?</strong></p>
<p>Amazon CloudWatch is an AWS cloud native service which provides unified observability on a single platform for monitoring AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS. Amazon CloudWatch can be used to collect monitoring and operational data in the form of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">logs</a>, track <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/working_with_metrics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metrics</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/WhatIsCloudWatchEvents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">events</a>and set <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alarms</a>. It also provides a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Dashboards.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unified view</a> of AWS resources, applications, and services that run on AWS and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/how-to-monitor-hybrid-environment-with-aws-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on-premises servers</a>. Amazon CloudWatch helps you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health of your workloads. Amazon CloudWatch provides <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Insights-Sections.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actionable insights</a> for AWS, hybrid, and on-premises applications and infrastructure resources. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cross-account observability</a> is an addition to CloudWatch’s unified observability capability.</p>
<p><strong>Which AWS Services are natively integrated with Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon CloudWatch Logs?</strong></p>
<p>Amazon CloudWatch natively integrates with more than 70+ AWS services allowing customers to collect infrastructure metrics for simplified monitoring and scalability with no action. Please check the documentation for a complete list of supported <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS services that publish CloudWatch metrics</a>. Currently, more than 30 AWS services publish logs to CloudWatch. Please check the documentation for a complete list of supported <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/aws-services-sending-logs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS services that publish logs to CloudWatch Logs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Where do I get the list of all the published metrics from all AWS Services to Amazon CloudWatch?</strong></p>
<p>The list of all the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Services that publish metrics</a> to Amazon CloudWatch is in AWS documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Where do I get started for collecting &amp; monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/working_with_metrics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon CloudWatch collects metrics</a> from various AWS Services which can be viewed through <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or an API</a>. Amazon CloudWatch collects <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available metrics</a> for Amazon EC2 Instances. For additional custom metrics customers can make use of unified CloudWatch agent to collect and monitor.</p>

<p>Related AWS Observability Workshop: <a href="https://catalog.workshops.aws/observability/en-US/aws-native/metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metrics</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>My Amazon EC2 Instance requires very granular level of monitoring, what do I do?</strong></p>
<p>By default, Amazon EC2 sends metric data to CloudWatch in 5-minute periods as Basic Monitoring for an instance. To send metric data for your instance to CloudWatch in 1-minute periods, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-cloudwatch-new.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">detailed monitoring</a> can be enabled on the instance.</p>
<p><strong>I want to publish own metrics for my application. Is there an option?</strong></p>
<p>Customers can also publish their own <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom metrics</a> to CloudWatch using the API or CLI through standard resolution of 1 minute granularity or high resolution granularity down to 1 sec interval.</p>
<p>The CloudWatch agent also supports collecting custom metrics from EC2 instances in specialized scenarios like <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Agent-network-performance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Network performance metrics for EC2 instances</a> running on Linux that use the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA), <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Agent-NVIDIA-GPU.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NVIDIA GPU metrics</a> from Linux servers and Process metrics using procstat plugin from <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Agent-procstat-process-metrics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">individual processes</a> on Linux &amp; Windows servers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Related AWS Observability Workshop: <a href="https://catalog.workshops.aws/observability/en-US/aws-native/metrics/publishmetrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public custom metrics</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What more support is available for collecting custom metrics through Amazon CloudWatch agent?</strong></p>
<p>Custom metrics from applications or services can be retrieved using the unified CloudWatch agent with support for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Agent-custom-metrics-statsd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StatsD</a>or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Agent-custom-metrics-collectd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collectd</a>protocols. StatsD is a popular open-source solution that can gather metrics from a wide variety of applications. StatsD is especially useful for instrumenting own metrics, which supports both Linux and Windows based servers. collectd protocol is a popular open-source solution supported only on Linux Servers with plugins that can gather system statistics for a wide variety of applications.</p>
<p><strong>My workload contains lot of ephemeral resources and generates logs in high-cardinality, what is the recommended approach collecting and measuring the metrics and logs?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Embedded_Metric_Format.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CloudWatch embedded metric format</a> enables customers to ingest complex high-cardinality application data in the form of logs and to generate actionable metrics from ephemeral resources such as Lambda functions and containers. By doing so, customers can embed custom metrics alongside detailed log event data without having to instrument or maintain separate code, while gaining powerful analytical capabilities on your log data and CloudWatch can automatically extract the custom metrics to help visualize the data and set alarm on them for real-time incident detection.</p>
