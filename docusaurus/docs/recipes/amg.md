# Amazon Managed Grafana

[Amazon Managed Grafana][amg-main] is a fully managed service based on open 
source Grafana, enabling you to analyze your metrics, logs, and traces without
having to provision servers, configure and update software, or do the heavy 
lifting involved in securing and scaling Grafana in production. You can create,
explore, and share observability dashboards with your team, connecting to
multiple data sources.
