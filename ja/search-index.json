ログとトレースはどのように異なりますか？​ ログは単一のアプリケーションとそれに関連するイベントに限定されます。例えば、ユーザーがマイクロサービスプラットフォームでホストされているウェブサイトにログインし、購入を行う場合、複数のアプリケーションから、そのユーザーに関連するログが生成される可能性があります： フロントエンドウェブサーバー 認証サービス 在庫管理サービス 決済処理バックエンド ユーザーに領収書を送信するアウトバウンドメーラー これらのそれぞれが、このユーザーに関する何らかのログを記録する可能性があり、そのデータはすべて価値があります。しかし、トレースは、これらの個別のコンポーネントすべてにまたがる、ユーザーの単一のトランザクションにおける相互作用の全体像を一貫した形で提示します。 このように、トレースはアクティビティの単一のビューを示すことを目的とした、複数のサービスからのイベントのコレクションであるのに対し、ログはそれを作成したアプリケーションのコンテキストに紐付けられています。 どのシグナルタイプがイミュータブルですか？​ 基本的な 3 つのシグナルタイプ（メトリクス、ログ、トレース）は、実装によって保証レベルは異なりますが、すべてイミュータブルです。 例えば、ログのイミュータブル性は多くのガバナンスフレームワークにおいて厳格な要件であり、これを確保するための多くのツールが存在します。 同様に、メトリクスとトレースも 常に イミュータブルであるべきです。 これは「不正確なデータ」や誤ったデータの処理に関する疑問につながります。 AWS オブザーバビリティサービスでは、誤って送信されたメトリクスやトレースを削除する機能はありません。 CloudWatch Logs ではログストリーム全体の削除は可能ですが、一度収集されたデータを遡って変更することはできません。 これは設計上の仕様であり、お客様のデータを最大限の注意を払って扱うための重要な機能です。 オブザーバビリティにとってイミュータブル(不変性)が重要な理由​ イミュータブル(不変性)は、オブザーバビリティにとって最も重要です！過去のデータが変更可能であれば、システムやオペレーションを進化させる際の 選択 に影響を与える重要なエラーや異常な動作を見失ってしまいます。 例えば、時系列データに大きな時間的なギャップがあるメトリクスのデータポイントは、単にデータ収集の欠如を示すだけでなく、インフラストラクチャにおけるより大きな問題を示している可能性があります。同様に、「null」データについても、空の時系列であっても価値があります。 ガバナンスの観点からは、アプリケーションのログやトレースを事後に変更することは、否認防止 の原則に違反します。これにより、システム内のデータがソースアプリケーションによって意図された通りのものであると信頼することができなくなります。 Blast Radius とは何ですか？​ 変更の Blast Radius とは、環境内で発生する可能性のある影響範囲のことです。たとえば、データベーススキーマを変更する場合、潜在的なリスクには、データベース内のデータと、それに依存するすべてのアプリケーションが含まれる可能性があります。 一般的に、変更の Blast Radius を小さくすることはベストプラクティスとされています。また、可能な限り変更を小さく、安全で、元に戻せる単位に分割することが推奨されています。 クラウドファーストアプローチとは何か？​ クラウドファースト戦略とは、組織がインフラストラクチャの全部または大部分をクラウドコンピューティングプラットフォームに移行することです。物理的なサーバーなどのリソースを使用する代わりに、クラウド上にリソースを配置します。 コロケーション型のハードウェアに慣れている人にとっては、これは急進的に思えるかもしれません。しかし、その逆も真実です。クラウドファーストの考え方を採用した開発者は、サーバーを物理的な場所に縛り付けることを考えられないと感じています。クラウドファーストのチームは、サーバーを個別のハードウェアや仮想サーバーとしてではなく、ビジネス機能を実現するためのソフトウェアとして考えています。 クラウドファーストは、2010 年代のモバイルファースト、2000 年代初頭の仮想化に相当する 2020 年代のトレンドです。 技術的負債とは何か？​ Wikipedia から引用： ソフトウェア開発において、技術的負債（デザイン負債やコード負債とも呼ばれる）とは、より時間のかかる適切なアプローチを採用する代わりに、容易な（限定的な）解決策を現時点で選択することによって生じる、追加の手直しの暗黙的なコストのことです。 基本的に、レガシーなコード、アプリケーション、人的プロセスを取り除くことなく作業を追加していくと、時間とともに負債が蓄積されていきます。 技術的負債は、絶対的な生産性を低下させます。 例えば、ビジネスにほとんどまたはまったく直接的な価値を提供しないレガシーシステムのメンテナンスに時間の 10% を費やさなければならない場合、その 10% は支払わなければならない コスト となります。 技術的負債を減らすことは、価値を生み出す新しい製品を作るための実質的な時間を増やすことと同じです。 関心の分離とは​ オブザーバビリティソリューションのコンテキストにおいて、関心の分離とは、ワークロードやアプリケーションの機能領域を、独立して管理される個別のコンポーネントに分割することを意味します。 各コンポーネントは、個別の関心事（ログ構造やログの 出力 など）に対応します。 基盤となるコードを変更せずにコンポーネントの設定を制御できることで、開発者は自身の関心事（アプリケーションの機能や機能開発）に集中でき、DevOps 担当者はシステムのパフォーマンスの最適化やトラブルシューティングに集中できます。 関心の分離は、コンピュータサイエンスにおけるコアコンセプトです。 オペレーショナルエクセレンスとは何か？​ オペレーショナルエクセレンスとは、ワークロードの運用に関連するベストプラクティスを実践することです。AWS には Well-Architected に特化したフレームワーク全体があります。オペレーショナルエクセレンスを始めるには、このページをご覧ください。 このページを編集 次へ Amazon CloudWatch - よくある質問 ログとトレースはどのように異なりますか？

オブザーバビリティは、成熟したツール群を持つ幅広いトピックです。しかし、すべてのツールがすべてのソリューションに適しているわけではありません。 オブザーバビリティの要件、設定、最終的なデプロイメントを進めていく上で、オブザーバビリティ戦略に関する意思決定プロセスの参考となる 5 つの重要なベストプラクティスをまとめました。 重要なものをモニタリングする​ オブザーバビリティで最も重要な考慮事項は、サーバー、ネットワーク、アプリケーション、顧客ではありません。それは、あなた、ビジネス、プロジェクト、またはユーザーにとって重要なものです。 まずは成功基準から始めましょう。例えば、e コマースアプリケーションを運営している場合、成功の指標は過去 1 時間の購入数かもしれません。非営利団体の場合は、月間目標に対する寄付金額かもしれません。決済プロセッサーは取引処理時間を監視し、大学は学生の出席率を測定したいかもしれません。 ヒント 成功の指標は誰にとっても異なります！ここでは e コマースアプリケーションを例として使用していますが、あなたのプロジェクトは全く異なる測定基準を持つかもしれません。しかし、アドバイスは同じです：良い 状態がどのようなものかを知り、それを測定してください。 アプリケーションの種類に関係なく、まずは主要な指標を特定することから始める必要があります。そして、そこから Working Backwards1 して、アプリケーションやインフラストラクチャの観点からどのような影響があるかを確認します。例えば、Web サーバーの CPU 使用率が高くなることで顧客満足度が危険にさらされ、結果として売上に影響を与えるのであれば、CPU 使用率のモニタリングは重要です！ 目標を理解し、測定しましょう！​ 重要なトップレベルの KPI を特定したら、次はそれらを追跡・測定する自動化された方法を持つことです。 ワークロードの運用を監視するのと同じシステムでこれを行うことが、成功の重要な要因となります。 e コマースワークロードの例では、以下のようになります： 売上データを時系列として公開する 同じシステムでユーザー登録を追跡する ユーザーの Web ページ滞在時間を測定し、（同様に）このデータを時系列にプッシュする ほとんどの顧客は既にこのデータを持っていますが、オブザーバビリティの観点からは必ずしも適切な場所に配置されているわけではありません。 売上データやユーザー登録データは、通常、リレーショナルデータベースやビジネスインテリジェンスのレポーティングシステムで見つけることができます。 また、訪問時間のデータは、ログやReal User Monitoringから抽出できます。 メトリクスデータの元の場所やフォーマットに関係なく、時系列として維持する必要があります。 ビジネス、個人、学術、その他の目的に関わらず、最も重要なすべての主要メトリクスは、他のオブザーバビリティデータ（シグナルやテレメトリとも呼ばれる）と相関付けるために、時系列形式である必要があります。 図 1: 時系列の例 コンテキスト伝播とツールの選択​ ツールの選択は重要で、問題の運用と修復方法に大きな違いをもたらします。 しかし、最適とは言えないツールを選択することよりも、基本的なシグナルタイプすべてに対してツールを選ぶことの方が重要です。 例えば、ワークロードから基本的なログを収集しているものの、トランザクショントレースが欠けている場合、そこにギャップが生じます。 その結果、アプリケーション体験全体の一貫した視点が失われます。 最新のオブザーバビリティのアプローチは、すべてアプリケーショントレースによって「点と点を結ぶ」ことに依存しています。 システムの健全性と運用の全体像を把握するには、ログ、メトリクス、トレースを収集し、相関分析、異常検知、ダッシュボード、アラームなどを実行するツールが必要です。 備考 オブザーバビリティソリューションの中には、上記のすべての機能を含まないものもありますが、それらは既存のシステムを補完、拡張、または付加価値を提供することを目的としています。 いずれの場合も、オブザーバビリティプロジェクトを開始する際には、ツールの相互運用性と拡張性が重要な考慮事項となります。 すべてのワークロードは異なりますが、共通のツールを使用することで迅速な結果が得られます​ すべてのワークロードで共通のツールセットを使用することには、運用上の摩擦やトレーニングを減らすなどの利点があり、一般的にツールやベンダーの数を減らすよう努めるべきです。 そうすることで、既存のオブザーバビリティソリューションを新しい環境やワークロードに迅速にデプロイでき、問題が発生した際の解決時間も短縮できます。 ツールは、基本的なインフラストラクチャ、アプリケーション、Web サイト、およびその間のすべてのレイヤーを観察できるほど広範なものである必要があります。 単一のツールでは対応できない場合、オープンスタンダードでオープンソースのツールを使用することがベストプラクティスです。これにより、最も広範なクロスプラットフォーム統合の可能性が得られます。 既存のツールとプロセスとの統合​ 一から作り直す必要はありません！「円」は既に素晴らしい形であり、データサイロではなく、常に協調的でオープンなシステムを構築すべきです。 既存の ID プロバイダー (Active Directory や SAML ベースの IdP など) と統合します。 既存の IT トラブルトラッキングシステム (JIRA や ServiceNow など) がある場合は、それと統合して問題が発生した際に迅速に対応できるようにします。 既存のワークロード管理やエスカレーションツール (PagerDuty や OpsGenie など) がある場合は、それらを活用してください！ Ansible、SaltStack、CloudFormation、TerraForm、CDK などの Infrastructure as Code (IaC) ツールは、すべて優れたツールです。これらを使用してオブザーバビリティを他のすべてのものと同様に管理し、現在使用している Infrastructure as Code ツールと同じものでオブザーバビリティソリューションを構築してください (Day One からオブザーバビリティを含める を参照)。 自動化と機械学習の活用​ コンピュータはパターンを見つけることが得意で、データがパターンに従っていない場合も見つけることができます！ 監視するデータポイントが数百、数千、あるいは数百万にもなる場合、それぞれの正常なしきい値を理解することは不可能です。 しかし、多くのオブザーバビリティソリューションには、データのベースラインを設定する手間のかかる作業を管理する異常検知と機械学習の機能が備わっています。 これを「正常な状態を知る」と呼んでいます。 ワークロードを徹底的に負荷テストしている場合は、これらの正常なパフォーマンスメトリクスをすでに把握しているかもしれません。 しかし、複雑な分散アプリケーションでは、すべてのメトリクスのベースラインを作成することは扱いにくい場合があります。 ここで、異常検知、自動化、機械学習が非常に重要になります。 アプリケーションの健全性のベースライン設定とアラートを代行して管理するツールを活用することで、目標に集中し、重要なものを監視することができます。 ワークロードのすべての階層からテレメトリを収集する​ アプリケーションは単独で存在しているわけではありません。ネットワークインフラストラクチャ、クラウドプロバイダー、インターネットサービスプロバイダー、SaaS パートナー、そしてあなたの管理下にある、またはない他のコンポーネントとの相互作用は、すべてあなたの成果に影響を与える可能性があります。 ワークロード全体を包括的に把握することが重要です。 統合に焦点を当てる​ 計装する領域を 1 つ選ぶとすれば、それは間違いなくコンポーネント間の統合になります。これは、オブザーバビリティの力が最も顕著に表れる部分です。原則として、あるコンポーネントやサービスが別のコンポーネントやサービスを呼び出す際には、少なくとも以下のデータポイントを測定する必要があります： リクエストとレスポンスの所要時間 レスポンスのステータス そして、オブザーバビリティが必要とする一貫性のある全体的なビューを作成するために、収集されるシグナルには、リクエストチェーン全体の単一の一意な識別子を含める必要があります。 エンドユーザーエクスペリエンスを忘れずに​ ワークロードの完全な把握には、エンドユーザーの体験を含むすべての層での理解が必要です。 空きディスク容量や CPU 使用率の監視と同様に（あるいはそれ以上に）重要なのは、ユーザーエクスペリエンスの低下によってサービス目標が危険にさらされる可能性を測定、定量化、理解することです。 Web サイトやモバイルアプリケーションなど、エンドユーザーと直接やり取りするワークロードの場合、Real User Monitoring は、ユーザーへの「ラストマイル」配信だけでなく、実際のアプリケーション体験も監視します。 結局のところ、ユーザーがサービスを実際に利用できなければ、オブザーバビリティの取り組みは意味をなしません。 データは力なりですが、細かいことは気にしすぎないようにしましょう​ アプリケーションの規模によっては、シグナルを収集すべきコンポーネントが非常に多くなる可能性があります。 シグナルの収集は重要で有用ですが、その労力に見合わない場合もあります。 そのため、ベストプラクティスとしては、重要なものをモニタリングする ことから始め、これを重要な統合やクリティカルなコンポーネントのマッピングに活用し、適切な詳細に焦点を当てることです。 Day One からオブザーバビリティを組み込む​ セキュリティと同様に、オブザーバビリティは開発やオペレーションの後付けであってはいけません。 ベストプラクティスは、セキュリティと同様にオブザーバビリティを計画の早い段階で組み込むことです。 これにより、人々が作業するためのモデルが作成され、アプリケーションの不透明な部分が減少します。 主要な開発作業が完了した後にトランザクショントレースを追加するには、自動計装を使用しても時間がかかります。 その労力は大きな見返りをもたらします！ しかし、開発サイクルの後半でこれを行うと、手戻りが発生する可能性があります。 オブザーバビリティをワークロードに後から組み込むのではなく、作業を 加速 するために活用してください。 適切なログ、メトリクス、トレースの収集により、アプリケーション開発が迅速化され、優れたプラクティスが促進され、将来の迅速な問題解決の基盤が築かれます。 Footnotes​ Amazon では、お客様とその成果に対する徹底的なこだわりを持つ方法として、Working Backwards プロセスを広範に使用しており、オブザーバビリティソリューションに取り組む誰もが同じ方法で自身の目標から逆算して作業することを強くお勧めします。Working Backwards の詳細については、Werner Vogels のブログをご覧ください。 ↩ このページを編集 次へ

このページの見出し Container Insights を使用したサービスメトリクスの収集 サービスメトリクスは、コードに計装を追加することで取得されるアプリケーションレベルのメトリクスです。これらのメトリクスは、2 つの異なるアプローチでアプリケーションから収集できます。 プッシュアプローチ: アプリケーションがメトリクスデータを直接送信先に送信します。例えば、CloudWatch PutMetricData API を使用して、アプリケーションはメトリクスデータポイントを CloudWatch に公開できます。また、アプリケーションは OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) を使用して、gRPC や HTTP 経由で OpenTelemetry Collector などのエージェントにデータを送信することもできます。後者は、メトリクスデータを最終的な送信先に送信します。 プルアプローチ: アプリケーションが事前に定義されたフォーマットで HTTP エンドポイントにメトリクスデータを公開します。このエンドポイントにアクセスできるエージェントがデータをスクレイピングし、送信先に送信します。 CloudWatch Container Insights による Prometheus のモニタリング​ Prometheus は、人気のあるオープンソースのシステムモニタリングおよびアラート通知ツールキットです。コンテナ化されたアプリケーションからプル方式でメトリクスを収集するための事実上の標準として台頭しています。Prometheus を使用してメトリクスを取得するには、まず主要なプログラミング言語で利用可能な Prometheus の クライアントライブラリ を使用してアプリケーションコードを計装する必要があります。メトリクスは通常、Prometheus サーバーが読み取れるように、アプリケーションによって HTTP 経由で公開されます。 Prometheus サーバーがアプリケーションの HTTP エンドポイントをスクレイピングすると、クライアントライブラリは追跡されているすべてのメトリクスの現在の状態をサーバーに送信します。サーバーは、管理しているローカルストレージにメトリクスを保存するか、CloudWatch などのリモートの送信先にメトリクスデータを送信することができます。 CloudWatch Container Insights による Prometheus のモニタリング を使用すると、Amazon ECS クラスターで Prometheus の機能を活用できます。これは EC2 と Fargate にデプロイされた Amazon ECS クラスターで利用可能です。CloudWatch エージェントは Prometheus サーバーの代替として使用でき、オブザーバビリティを向上させるために必要なモニタリングツールの数を削減します。Amazon ECS にデプロイされたコンテナ化アプリケーションからの Prometheus メトリクスの検出を自動化し、メトリクスデータをパフォーマンスログイベントとして CloudWatch に送信します。 備考 Amazon ECS クラスターに Prometheus メトリクス収集機能を持つ CloudWatch エージェントをデプロイする手順は、Amazon CloudWatch ユーザーガイド に記載されています。 警告 Container Insights による Prometheus のモニタリングで収集されたメトリクスは、カスタムメトリクスとして課金されます。CloudWatch の料金の詳細については、Amazon CloudWatch の料金 をご参照ください。 Amazon ECS クラスターでのターゲットの自動検出​ CloudWatch エージェントは、Prometheus ドキュメントの scrape_config セクションで定義されている標準的な Prometheus スクレイプ設定をサポートしています。Prometheus は、数十種類のサービスディスカバリメカニズムのいずれかを使用して、スクレイピングターゲットの静的および動的な検出をサポートしています。Amazon ECS には組み込みのサービスディスカバリメカニズムがないため、エージェントはファイルベースのターゲット検出に対する Prometheus のサポートに依存しています。ファイルベースのターゲット検出のためにエージェントを設定するには、エージェントの起動に使用されるタスク定義で定義される 2 つの設定パラメータが必要です。これらのパラメータをカスタマイズすることで、エージェントが収集するメトリクスをきめ細かく制御できます。 最初のパラメータには、以下のようなサンプルの Prometheus グローバル設定が含まれています： global: scrape_interval: 30s scrape_timeout: 10s scrape_configs: - job_name: cwagent_ecs_auto_sd sample_limit: 10000 file_sd_configs: - files: [ \"/tmp/cwagent_ecs_auto_sd.yaml\" ] 2 番目のパラメータには、エージェントがスクレイピングターゲットを検出するのに役立つ設定が含まれています。エージェントは定期的に Amazon ECS に API コールを行い、この設定の ecs_service_discovery セクションで定義されたタスク定義パターンに一致する実行中の ECS タスクのメタデータを取得します。検出されたすべてのターゲットは、CloudWatch エージェントコンテナにマウントされたファイルシステム上の /tmp/cwagent_ecs_auto_sd.yaml という結果ファイルに書き込まれます。以下のサンプル設定では、プレフィックス BackendTask で名前付けられたすべてのタスクからメトリクスをスクレイピングするようにエージェントが設定されます。Amazon ECS クラスターでのターゲットの自動検出については、詳細なガイドを参照してください。 { \"logs\":{ \"metrics_collected\":{ \"prometheus\":{

トレーシングエージェントの選択 エージェントの選択​ AWS は、トレース 収集のために 2 つのツールセットを直接サポートしています（オブザーバビリティパートナー も多数あります）： AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry（一般的に ADOT と呼ばれます） X-Ray の SDK と デーモン オブザーバビリティソリューションを発展させる上で、どのツールを使用するかの選択は重要な決定事項です。 これらのツールは相互に排他的ではなく、必要に応じて組み合わせることができます。 また、この選択には最適な方法があります。 しかし、まず OpenTelemetry (OTEL) の現状を理解する必要があります。 OTEL は、オブザーバビリティシグナルの現在の業界標準仕様であり、3 つのコアシグナルタイプ（メトリクス、トレース、ログ）の定義を含んでいます。 しかし、OTEL は常に存在していたわけではなく、OpenMetrics や OpenTracing などの以前の仕様から進化してきました。 オブザーバビリティベンダーは近年、OpenTelemetry Line Protocol (OTLP) のオープンサポートを開始しました。 AWS X-Ray と CloudWatch は OTEL 仕様以前からあり、他の主要なオブザーバビリティソリューションも同様です。 しかし、AWS X-Ray サービスは ADOT を使用して OTEL トレースを容易に受け入れることができます。 ADOT には、X-Ray や他の ISV ソリューションにテレメトリを直接送信するための統合機能が既に組み込まれています。 トランザクショントレースソリューションには、シグナルを収集するためのエージェントとアプリケーションへの統合が必要です。 これにより、テスト、保守、アップグレードが必要なライブラリの形で技術的負債が生まれ、将来ソリューションを変更する場合には再ツール化が必要になる可能性があります。 X-Ray に含まれる SDK は、AWS が提供する緊密に統合された計装ソリューションの一部です。 ADOT は、X-Ray が多くのトレースソリューションの 1 つに過ぎない、より広範な業界ソリューションの一部です。 どちらのアプローチでも X-Ray でエンドツーエンドのトレースを実装できますが、最も有用なアプローチを決定するために、その違いを理解することが重要です。 備考 以下が必要な場合は、AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry でアプリケーションを計装することをお勧めします： コードを再計装することなく、複数の異なるトレースバックエンドにトレースを送信する機能。例えば、X-Ray コンソールから Zipkin に移行する場合、コレクターの設定のみを変更し、アプリケーションコードは変更しません。 OpenTelemetry コミュニティによって維持される、各言語用の多数のライブラリ計装のサポート。 備考 以下が必要な場合は、アプリケーションの計装に X-Ray SDK を選択することをお勧めします： 緊密に統合された単一ベンダーソリューション。 Node.js、Python、Ruby、.NET を使用する場合の X-Ray 集中サンプリングルールとの統合。これには X-Ray コンソールからサンプリングルールを設定し、複数のホストで自動的に使用する機能が含まれます。 このページを編集 前へ ベストプラクティスの概要 次へ Kubecost の使用

クロスアカウントオブザーバビリティ 単一の AWS リージョン内で複数の AWS アカウントにデプロイされたアプリケーションのモニタリングは課題となる場合があります。Amazon CloudWatch のクロスアカウントオブザーバビリティ1 は、AWS リージョン2 内の複数のアカウントにまたがるアプリケーションのシームレスなモニタリングとトラブルシューティングを可能にすることで、このプロセスを簡素化します。このチュートリアルでは、2 つの AWS アカウント間でクロスアカウントオブザーバビリティを設定する手順をスクリーンショット付きで説明します。また、より広範なスケーラビリティのために AWS Organizations を通じたデプロイも可能です。 用語集​ Amazon CloudWatch でクロスアカウントのオブザーバビリティを効果的に実現するには、以下の主要な用語を理解する必要があります： 用語 説明 モニタリングアカウント 複数のソースアカウントから生成されたオブザーバビリティデータを表示および操作できる中央の AWS アカウント ソースアカウント アカウント内のリソースからオブザーバビリティデータを生成する個別の AWS アカウント Sink ソースアカウントがオブザーバビリティデータをリンクして共有するための接続ポイントとして機能する、モニタリングアカウント内のリソース。各アカウントは AWS リージョン ごとに 1 つの Sink を持つことができます2 オブザーバビリティリンク ソースアカウントとモニタリングアカウント間の接続を表すリソースで、オブザーバビリティデータの共有を可能にします。リンクはソースアカウントによって管理されます。 Amazon CloudWatch でクロスアカウントのオブザーバビリティを正常に設定および管理するには、これらの定義を理解してください。 AWS コンソールを使用したステップバイステップのチュートリアル​ 前提条件​ このチュートリアルを完了するには、3 つの AWS アカウントが必要です：1 つのモニタリングアカウントと 2 つのソースアカウントです。 モニタリングアカウントとソースアカウント間のクロスアカウントリンクを作成するには、ユーザーまたはロールが AWS CloudWatch クロスアカウントセットアップガイド3 に記載されている権限を最低限持っている必要があります。 ステップ 1: モニタリングアカウントのセットアップ​ モニタリングアカウント​ モニタリングアカウントを設定するには、以下の手順に従ってください： https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch で CloudWatch コンソールを開き、クロスアカウントモニタリングアカウントを設定する AWS リージョンを選択します。このデモでは、ヨーロッパ (フランクフルト) リージョン (eu-central-1) を使用します。 ナビゲーションペインで、設定 を選択します。 このデモでは、デフォルトのアカウントグローバル設定を使用し、モニタリングアカウント設定 セクション内の 設定 を選択します。 モニタリングアカウントと共有するデータの種類を選択した後、「ソースアカウントのリスト」ボックスにソースアカウント ID を貼り付けます。このデモでは、WorkloadAcc1 と WorkloadAcc2 の ID を使用します。メトリクス、ログ、トレースが選択されています。フィルタリングが可能なのはメトリクスとログのみで、その他は常に完全に共有されます。ServiceLens と X-Ray の場合、メトリクス、ログ、トレースを有効にする必要があります。Application Insights の場合は、Application Insights アプリケーションも有効にします。Internet Monitor の場合は、メトリクス、ログ、Internet Monitor – Monitors を有効にします。 備考 CloudWatch クロスアカウントオブザーバビリティでテレメトリタイプを設定する際は、その依存関係を理解することが重要です。メトリクス、ログ、トレースは個別に設定できますが、他の CloudWatch 機能には特定の要件があります。ServiceLens と X-Ray の機能には、メトリクス、ログ、トレースの 3 つすべてが必要です。より高度なモニタリングのために、Application Insights ではメトリクス、ログ、トレース、および Application Insights アプリケーションを有効にする必要があります。同様に、Internet Monitor では、メトリクス、ログ、および Internet Monitor - Monitors を有効にする必要があります。以下の表でこれらの依存関係を詳しく説明します： テレメトリタイプ 説明 CloudWatch クロスアカウントオブザーバビリティの依存関係 Amazon CloudWatch のメトリクス すべてのメトリクス名前空間を共有するか、サブセットにフィルタリング なし Amazon CloudWatch Logs のロググループ すべてのロググループを共有するか、サブセットにフィルタリング なし ServiceLens と X-Ray すべてのトレースを共有（フィルタリング不可） ServiceLens と X-Ray にはメトリクス、ログ、トレースの有効化が必要 Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights のアプリケーション すべてのアプリケーションを共有（フィルタリング不可） メトリクス、ログ、トレース、および Application Insights アプリケーションの有効化が必要 CloudWatch Internet Monitor のモニター すべてのモニターを共有（フィルタリング不可） メトリクス、ログ、および Internet Monitor - Monitors の有効化が必要 モニタリングアカウントの AWS コンソールで、以下の図が表示され、モニタリングアカウントが正常に設定されたことが確認できます。 ヒント モニタリングアカウントの設定が完了したら、ソースアカウントをリンクする必要があります。ソースアカウントをリンクする方法には、AWS Organizations を使用する方法と個別のアカウントをリンクする方法の 2 つがあります。ステップ 2 では、個別のアカウントを設定するプロセスを説明します。ただし、ソースアカウントにログインして変更を加える前に、モニタリングアカウントシンク ARN などの、設定したばかりのモニタリングアカウントから情報を収集する必要があります。 モニタリングアカウントの AWS コンソールで前回停止した場所から、アカウントをリンクするためのリソース を選択します。 AWS コンソールで「設定の詳細」セクションを展開します。ここでコピーして保存する必要があるモニタリングアカウントシンク ARN が表示されます。この情報は、ステップ 2 でソースアカウントをリンクする際に必要になります。 まとめ​ 前のステップでは、モニタリングアカウントシンクを、スタンドアロンまたは組織の一部であるかに関わらず、ソースアカウントとリンクするように設定しました。基本的に、上記のステップでは、ソースアカウントの統合を許可するモニタリングアカウントシンクに設定ポリシーを作成しました。AWS コンソールの設定を通じて生成されたサンプルポリシーは以下の通りです： { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": { \"AWS\": [ \"${WorkloadAcc1}\", // Workload Account \"${WorkloadAcc2}\" // Workload Account ] }, \"Action\": [ \"oam:CreateLink\", \"oam:UpdateLink\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\", \"Condition\": { \"ForAllValues:StringEquals\": { \"oam:ResourceTypes\": [ \"AWS::Logs::LogGroup\", \"AWS::CloudWatch::Metric\", \"AWS::XRay::Trace\" ] } } } ] } AWS Organizations を使用して設定する場合、PrincipalOrgID 条件に基づいて AWS 組織内のすべての AWS アカウントがリンクの作成や更新を信頼できるため、モニタリングアカウントシンクに適用される設定ポリシーはそれ以上の変更を必要としません。そのようなサンプルポリシーは以下の通りです： { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Principal\": \"*\", \"Action\": [\"oam:CreateLink\", \"oam:UpdateLink\"], \"Resource\": \"*\", \"Condition\": { \"ForAllValues:StringEquals\": { \"oam:ResourceTypes\": [ \"AWS::Logs::LogGroup\", \"AWS::CloudWatch::Metric\", \"AWS::XRay::Trace\", \"AWS::ApplicationInsights::Application\", \"AWS::InternetMonitor::Monitor\" ] }, \"ForAnyValue:StringEquals\": { \"aws:PrincipalOrgID\": \"${OrganizationId}\" // AWS Organization as Condition } } } ] } ステップ 2: ソースアカウントをリンクする​ 個別アカウントのリンク​ ステップ 1 でモニタリングアカウントを設定した後、個別の AWS ソースアカウントを設定します。このアプローチは、組織外のアカウントを扱う場合や、特定のスタンドアロンアカウントのモニタリングを確立する必要がある場合に特に有用です。AWS Organizations は複数のアカウントを管理するためのスケーラブルなソリューションを提供しますが、個別のアカウント設定では、より細かな制御と柔軟性を提供します。 ソースアカウントの設定を進める前に、ステップ 1 で取得したモニタリングアカウントのシンク ARN をコピーしていることを確認してください。これは接続を確立するために必要となります。 個別のソースアカウントをリンクするには、以下の手順に従ってください： https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch で CloudWatch コンソールを開き、クロスアカウントモニタリングアカウントを設定する AWS リージョンを選択します。このデモでは、ヨーロッパ (フランクフルト) リージョン (eu-central-1) を使用します。 ナビゲーションペインで、Settings を選択します。 このデモでは、アカウントのグローバル設定のデフォルト設定のままにし、Source account configuration セクション内の Configure を選択します。 AWS コンソールで、データタイプとして Logs、Metrics、Traces を選択します。デフォルトではすべてが共有されますが、モニタリングアカウントと共有したいログとメトリクスをフィルタリングすることで、より細かく設定することができます。リンクする前に必要な次のステップは、モニタリングアカウントの設定時にコピーしたモニタリングアカウントのシンク ARN を入力することです。 ソースアカウントの設定を完了する前の最後のステップは、ソースアカウントのデータがモニタリングアカウントと共有されることを確認することです。ポップアップボックスに「Confirm」と入力してこのアクションを確認します。 AWS コンソールの「Source account configuration」セクションで、アカウントが「linked」状態であることを示す緑色のステータスが表示されるはずです。 ヒント ステップ 2 を WorkloadAcc2 でも繰り返し、両方のワークロードアカウントからのオブザーバビリティテレメトリがモニタリングアカウントと共有されるようにします。 Step 3: 設定の検証​ ヒント モニタリングアカウントにログインしていることを確認してください https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch で CloudWatch コンソールを開き、Step 1 でクロスアカウントモニタリングを設定した AWS リージョンを選択します。このデモでは、ヨーロッパ (フランクフルト) リージョン (eu-central-1) を使用します。 ナビゲーションペインで、設定 を選択します。 モニタリングアカウントの設定 セクション内の モニタリングアカウントの管理 を選択します。 モニタリングアカウントの設定ページのリンクされたソースアカウントペインで、ソースアカウント としてリンクされた 2 つのワークロードアカウントが表示されます。 代替案: AWS Organizations の統合​ AWS CloudWatch のクロスアカウントオブザーバビリティにより、リージョン内の複数の AWS アカウントにまたがるアプリケーションの一元的な監視とトラブルシューティングが可能になります。 AWS Organizations を統合することで、セットアップを効率化し、すべてのアカウントにわたる設定を自動化できます。 この方法により、組織内の多数のアカウントにわたるモニタリングを効率的に処理できます。 前提条件:​ AWS Organizations が有効化され、メンバーアカウントが適切に含まれていること4。 リンクを作成するための適切な CloudFormation アクションを許可された IAM ロールを含む、子アカウントで AWS CloudFormation StackSets5 をデプロイする権限があること3。 組織内（または特定の OU）のソースアカウントがオブザーバビリティリンクを作成および更新することを許可するように設定されたモニタリングアカウントがあること6。 AWS CloudFormation StackSets は、すべてのメンバーアカウントで必要なサービスにリンクされたロールとオブザーバビリティ設定のデプロイを自動化します。 自動デプロイを有効にすると、新しく作成された AWS アカウントは必要なオブザーバビリティ設定を自動的に継承し、AWS 環境全体で統一されたモニタリング手法を維持しながら管理のオーバーヘッドを削減します。 IAM 権限、StackSet テンプレートのサンプル、モニタリングポリシーを含むステップバイステップの実装ガイドについては、AWS の公式ドキュメント7を参照してください。 ビデオチュートリアル​ クロスアカウントのオブザーバビリティ設定の詳細な手順については、AWS の公式 YouTube ガイド「Enable Cross-Account Observability in Amazon CloudWatch | Amazon Web Services」もご覧いただけます。このチュートリアルでは、集中監視アカウントの設定方法、複数のソースアカウントのリンク方法、CloudWatch コンソール内での共有オブザーバビリティデータの探索方法を視覚的に説明しています。 クロスアカウントのテレメトリーデータのクエリ​ ヒント モニタリングアカウントにログインしていることを確認してください 備考 Observability One Workshop8 の PetAdoption アプリケーションを再利用します。このデモでは、クロスアカウントのオブザーバビリティを説明するために、両方のワークロードアカウントにデプロイされています。 メトリクス​ 複数のアカウントのメトリクスを一元的な場所でモニタリングするには： モニタリングアカウントの CloudWatch コンソールで、左側のナビゲーションペインの「すべてのメトリクス」に移動します。これにより、リンクされたすべてのソースアカウントのメトリクスを表示できます。 アカウント ID フィルター :aws.AccountId= を使用して特定のアカウントのメトリクスをフィルタリングするか、名前空間とディメンションを選択して詳細を確認できます。このデモの範囲では、View Metrics in Observability One Workshop8 のガイドに従いましょう。ContainerInsights 名前空間を選択し、ClusterName、Namespace、PodName のディメンションを選択します。次に、メトリクス名 pod_cpu_utilization でフィルタリングします。グラフ化できる両方のワークロードアカウントからのメトリクスが表示されていることがわかります。 アラーム​ Amazon CloudWatch クロスアカウントアラーム9 を使用すると、モニタリングアカウントから複数の AWS アカウントにまたがってメトリクスを監視できます。 単一のメトリクスや数式の出力を監視するメトリクスアラームと、複数のアラーム（他のコンポジットアラームを含む）の状態を評価するコンポジットアラームを作成できます。 例えば、本番環境のすべてのアカウントで CPU 使用率が 80% を超えた場合にアラームをトリガーするように設定できます。 アラームがトリガーされると、Amazon SNS 通知の送信や AWS Lambda 関数の呼び出しなどのアクションを実行でき、タイムリーなアラートを受け取り、事前に対応することができます。 モニタリングアカウントでアラーム作成を一元化することで、アラートを効率化し、ワークロードの統合された運用ビューを得ることができます。 メトリクス の前のステップから続いて、「グラフ化されたメトリクス」を選択し、「アラームの作成」を選択することで、特定のメトリクスのアラームを作成できます。 ログ​ Logs Insights を使用すると、複数のアカウントのログを単一のインターフェースで照会および分析したり、ライブテイルでログを確認したりできます。以下は、Logs Insights を使用してアカウント間でログを照会する方法です： CloudWatch コンソールで「Logs Insights」に移動し、ロググループセレクターを使用して異なるアカウントからロググループを選択します。 次のステップは CloudWatch Logs Insights クエリを作成することです。このデモでは、One Observability Workshop8 の AWS ネイティブオブザーバビリティのサブセクション Logs Insight からクエリを取得し、少し修正します。過去数時間で、ワークロードアカウントごとに何種類のペットが採用され、その数がどれくらいだったかを確認します。 filter @message like /POST/ and @message like /completeadoption/ | parse @message \"* * * *:* *\" as method, request, protocol, ip, port, status | parse request \"*?petId=*&petType=*\" as requestURL, id, type | parse @log \"*:*\" as accountId, logGroupName // Modified to parse accountId from @log information | stats count() by type,accountId // Modified to group by previously parsed accountId 以下は、アカウント間でログをライブテイルする方法です： CloudWatch コンソールで Live Tail に移動し、フィルターペインで、ロググループセレクターを使用して異なるアカウントから ロググループを選択 し、開始をクリックします。 トレース​ モニタリングアカウントの CloudWatch コンソールで、ナビゲーションペインの X-Ray トレースから「トレースマップ」を選択します。トレースマップには、リンクされたすべてのソースアカウントからのデータが表示されます。必要に応じて、アカウントのフィルターを使用してください。 トレースマップ上の各ノードは、それが属する AWS アカウントを示しています。特定のスパンをより詳しく分析するには、「トレースの表示」を選択してください。 個々のセグメントについてより詳細な情報を得るには、特定のトレースを選択します。 トレースされた各パスのコンポーネントについて理解するには、エンドツーエンドのトレーススパンをより深く掘り下げてください。 まとめ​ Amazon CloudWatch のクロスアカウントオブザーバビリティを設定することで、複数の AWS アカウントにまたがるアプリケーションのパフォーマンスと健全性を一元的に把握できます。 これにより、アプリケーションが存在するアカウントに関係なく、モニタリング、トラブルシューティング、分析が簡素化されます。 このチュートリアルで説明した手順に従うことで、モニタリングアカウントを効果的に設定し、AWS Organizations または個別のアカウントリンクを使用してソースアカウントをリンクし、設定を確認できます。 これで CloudWatch コンソールを使用して、複数のアカウントにまたがるアプリケーションをモニタリングおよびトラブルシューティングできるようになりました。 クロスアカウントモニタリング機能をさらに強化するには、ダッシュボード、アラーム、ログなどの CloudWatch の各種機能を活用してください。 これらの機能により、アプリケーションのパフォーマンスと健全性についてより深い洞察が得られ、潜在的な問題を事前に特定して対処できるようになります。 リソース​ Footnotes​ AWS Blog - Amazon CloudWatch Cross-Account Observability ↩ CloudWatch cross-account observability ↩ ↩2

Container Insights を使用したシステムメトリクスの収集 このページの見出し Container Insights を使用したシステムメトリクスの収集 システムメトリクスは、CPU、メモリ、ディスク、ネットワークインターフェイスなど、サーバー上の物理コンポーネントを含む低レベルのリソースに関連しています。 CloudWatch Container Insights を使用して、Amazon ECS にデプロイされたコンテナ化アプリケーションからシステムメトリクスを収集、集約、要約します。 Container Insights は、コンテナの再起動失敗などの診断情報も提供し、問題の特定と迅速な解決を支援します。 これは EC2 と Fargate にデプロイされた Amazon ECS クラスターで利用できます。 Container Insights は、埋め込みメトリクスフォーマット を使用してパフォーマンスログイベントとしてデータを収集します。 これらのパフォーマンスログイベントは、高カーディナリティデータをスケールに応じて取り込み、保存できる構造化された JSON スキーマを使用するエントリです。 このデータから、CloudWatch はクラスター、ノード、サービス、タスクレベルで集約されたメトリクスを CloudWatch メトリクスとして作成します。 注記 CloudWatch で Container Insights のメトリクスを表示するには、Amazon ECS クラスターで Container Insights を有効にする必要があります。 これはアカウントレベルまたは個別のクラスターレベルで行うことができます。 アカウントレベルで有効にするには、次の AWS CLI コマンドを使用します： aws ecs put-account-setting --name \"containerInsights\" --value \"enabled 個別のクラスターレベルで有効にするには、次の AWS CLI コマンドを使用します： aws ecs update-cluster-settings --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME --settings name=containerInsights,value=enabled クラスターレベルとサービスレベルのメトリクスの収集​ デフォルトでは、CloudWatch Container Insights はタスク、サービス、クラスターレベルでメトリクスを収集します。 Amazon ECS エージェントは、EC2 コンテナインスタンス上の各タスク（ECS on EC2 と ECS on Fargate の両方）のメトリクスを収集し、パフォーマンスログイベントとして CloudWatch に送信します。 クラスターにエージェントをデプロイする必要はありません。 メトリクスの抽出元となるこれらのログイベントは、/aws/ecs/containerinsights/$CLUSTER_NAME/performance という名前の CloudWatch ロググループに収集されます。 これらのイベントから抽出されるメトリクスの完全なリストはこちらに記載されています。 Container Insights が収集するメトリクスは、CloudWatch コンソールのナビゲーションページから Container Insights を選択し、ドロップダウンリストから performance monitoring を選択することで、事前に構築されたダッシュボードで簡単に確認できます。 また、CloudWatch コンソールの Metrics セクションでも確認できます。 注記 Amazon EC2 インスタンス上で Amazon ECS を使用していて、Container Insights からネットワークとストレージのメトリクスを収集したい場合は、Amazon ECS エージェントバージョン 1.29 を含む AMI を使用してそのインスタンスを起動してください。 警告 Container Insights で収集されるメトリクスはカスタムメトリクスとして課金されます。CloudWatch の料金について詳しくは、Amazon CloudWatch の料金 をご覧ください。 インスタンスレベルのメトリクスの収集​ EC2 上でホストされている Amazon ECS クラスターに CloudWatch エージェントをデプロイすることで、クラスターからインスタンスレベルのメトリクスを収集できます。エージェントは daemon サービスとしてデプロイされ、クラスター内の各 EC2 コンテナインスタンスからパフォーマンスログイベントとしてインスタンスレベルのメトリクスを送信します。これらのイベントから抽出されるインスタンスレベルのメトリクスの完全なリストは、こちらに記載されています。 備考 インスタンスレベルのメトリクスを収集するために CloudWatch エージェントを Amazon ECS クラスターにデプロイする手順は、Amazon CloudWatch ユーザーガイドに記載されています。なお、このオプションは Fargate でホストされている Amazon ECS クラスターでは利用できません。 Logs Insights を使用したパフォーマンスログイベントの分析​ Container Insights は、埋め込みメトリクス形式のパフォーマンスログイベントを使用してメトリクスを収集します。 各ログイベントには、CPU やメモリなどのシステムリソース、またはタスクやサービスなどの ECS リソースで観測されたパフォーマンスデータが含まれる場合があります。 Container Insights がクラスター、サービス、タスク、コンテナレベルで Amazon ECS から収集するパフォーマンスログイベントの例は、こちらに記載されています。 CloudWatch は、これらのログイベント内のパフォーマンスデータの一部に基づいてメトリクスを生成します。 しかし、CloudWatch Logs Insights クエリを使用して、これらのログイベントのパフォーマンスデータをより深く分析することができます。 Logs Insights クエリを実行するためのユーザーインターフェースは、ナビゲーションページから Logs Insights を選択することで CloudWatch コンソールで利用できます。 ロググループを選択すると、CloudWatch Logs Insights は自動的にロググループ内のパフォーマンスログイベントのフィールドを検出し、右ペインの Discovered フィールドに表示します。 クエリ実行の結果は、時系列でのロググループ内のログイベントの棒グラフとして表示されます。 この棒グラフは、クエリと時間範囲に一致するロググループ内のイベントの分布を示しています。 備考 以下は、CPU とメモリ使用量のコンテナレベルのメトリクスを表示する Logs Insights クエリのサンプルです。 stats avg(CpuUtilized) as CPU,

Container Insights の概要 AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry を使用した Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights の活用 Amazon EKS における CloudWatch Container Insights での Fluent Bit の統合 Amazon EKS での Container Insights によるコスト削減 EKS Blueprints を使用した Container Insights のセットアップ はじめに​ Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights は、コンテナ化されたアプリケーションとマイクロサービスからメトリクスとログを収集、集約、要約するのに役立ちます。メトリクスデータは、埋め込みメトリクスフォーマット を使用してパフォーマンスログイベントとして収集されます。これらのパフォーマンスログイベントは、高カーディナリティデータをスケールに応じて取り込み、保存できる構造化された JSON スキーマを使用します。このデータから、CloudWatch はクラスター、ノード、Pod、タスク、サービスレベルで集約されたメトリクスを CloudWatch メトリクスとして作成します。Container Insights が収集するメトリクスは、CloudWatch の自動ダッシュボードで利用できます。Container Insights は、セルフマネージドノードグループ、マネージドノードグループ、AWS Fargate プロファイルを持つ Amazon EKS クラスターで利用できます。 コスト最適化の観点から、また Container Insights のコストを管理するために、CloudWatch はログデータから可能なすべてのメトリクスを自動的に作成するわけではありません。ただし、CloudWatch Logs Insights を使用して生のパフォーマンスログイベントを分析することで、追加のメトリクスとより詳細な粒度を表示できます。Container Insights によって収集されるメトリクスはカスタムメトリクスとして課金されます。CloudWatch の料金について詳しくは、Amazon CloudWatch の料金 をご覧ください。 Amazon EKS では、Container Insights は Amazon Elastic Container Registry を通じて Amazon が提供する CloudWatch エージェント のコンテナ化バージョンを使用して、クラスター内で実行中のすべてのコンテナを検出します。その後、パフォーマンススタックのあらゆる層でパフォーマンスデータを収集します。Container Insights は、収集するログとメトリクスに対して AWS KMS キーによる暗号化をサポートしています。この暗号化を有効にするには、Container Insights データを受け取るロググループに対して AWS KMS 暗号化を手動で有効にする必要があります。これにより、CloudWatch Container Insights は提供された AWS KMS キーを使用してこのデータを暗号化します。対称キーのみがサポートされており、ロググループの暗号化に非対称 AWS KMS キーはサポートされていません。Container Insights は Linux インスタンスでのみサポートされています。Amazon EKS 向け Container Insights は、これらの AWS リージョンでサポートされています。 AWS Distro for Open Telemetry を使用した Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights​ ここでは、Amazon EKS ワークロードから Container Insights メトリクスの収集を可能にするオプションの 1 つである AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) について詳しく説明します。AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) は、OpenTelemetry プロジェクトの AWS がサポートする安全なディストリビューションです。 ADOT を使用すると、アプリケーションを一度だけ計装することで、相関のあるメトリクスとトレースを複数のモニタリングソリューションに送信できます。CloudWatch Container Insights 向けの ADOT サポートにより、お客様は Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (Amazon EC2) 上で実行されている Amazon EKS クラスターから CPU、メモリ、ディスク、ネットワーク使用量などのシステムメトリクスを収集できます。これは Amazon CloudWatch エージェントと同じ体験を提供します。 ADOT Collector は、Amazon EKS および AWS Fargate プロファイル for Amazon EKS 向けの CloudWatch Container Insights のサポートを提供しています。お客様は、Amazon EKS クラスターにデプロイされた Pod の CPU やメモリ使用率などのコンテナと Pod のメトリクスを収集し、既存の CloudWatch Container Insights の体験を変更することなく CloudWatch ダッシュボードで確認できるようになりました。これにより、お客様はトラフィックに応じてスケールアップまたはダウンを判断し、コストを削減することができます。 ADOT Collector には、Receiver、Processor、Exporter という 3 つの主要なコンポーネントで構成されるパイプラインの概念があります。Receiver は、データがコレクターに取り込まれる方法です。指定された形式でデータを受け取り、内部形式に変換し、パイプラインで定義された Processors と Exporters に渡します。これはプルまたはプッシュベースで行うことができます。 Processor は、受信されてからエクスポートされるまでの間にデータのバッチ処理、フィルタリング、変換などのタスクを実行するためのオプションのコンポーネントです。Exporter は、メトリクス、ログ、またはトレースを送信する宛先を決定するために使用されます。コレクターのアーキテクチャでは、YAML 設定を通じてこのようなパイプラインの複数のインスタンスを定義できます。以下の図は、Amazon EKS および Fargate プロファイル付きの Amazon EKS にデプロイされた ADOT Collector インスタンスのパイプラインコンポーネントを示しています。 図：Amazon EKS にデプロイされた ADOT Collector インスタンスのパイプラインコンポーネント 上記のアーキテクチャでは、パイプラインで AWS Container Insights Receiver のインスタンスを使用し、Kubelet から直接メトリクスを収集しています。AWS Container Insights Receiver (awscontainerinsightreceiver) は、CloudWatch Container Insights をサポートする AWS 固有の Receiver です。 CloudWatch Container Insights は、コンテナ化されたアプリケーションとマイクロサービスからメトリクスとログを収集、集約、要約します。データは 埋め込みメトリクスフォーマット を使用してパフォーマンスログイベントとして収集されます。EMF データから、Amazon CloudWatch はクラスター、ノード、Pod、タスク、サービスレベルで集約された CloudWatch メトリクスを作成できます。以下は awscontainerinsightreceiver 設定のサンプル例です： receivers: awscontainerinsightreceiver: # all parameters are optional collection_interval: 60s container_orchestrator: eks add_service_as_attribute: true prefer_full_pod_name: false add_full_pod_name_metric_label: false これには、上記の設定を使用して Amazon EKS 上に DaemonSet としてコレクターをデプロイすることが含まれます。また、この Receiver が Kubelet から直接収集する、より完全なメトリクスセットにアクセスできます。クラスター内のすべてのノードからリソースメトリクスを収集するには、ADOT Collector の複数のインスタンスがあれば十分です。ADOT Collector の単一インスタンスは高負荷時に過負荷になる可能性があるため、常に複数のコレクターをデプロイすることをお勧めします。 図：Fargate プロファイル付き Amazon EKS にデプロイされた ADOT Collector インスタンスのパイプラインコンポーネント 上記のアーキテクチャでは、Kubernetes クラスター内のワーカーノード上の Kubelet が、/metrics/cadvisor エンドポイントで CPU、メモリ、ディスク、ネットワーク使用量などのリソースメトリクスを公開しています。しかし、EKS Fargate のネットワークアーキテクチャでは、Pod がそのワーカーノード上の Kubelet に直接アクセスすることはできません。 そのため、ADOT Collector は Kubernetes API サーバーを呼び出してワーカーノード上の Kubelet への接続をプロキシし、そのノード上のワークロードの Kubelet の cAdvisor メトリクスを収集します。これらのメトリクスは Prometheus 形式で利用可能です。したがって、コレクターは Prometheus サーバーの代替として Prometheus Receiver のインスタンスを使用し、Kubernetes API サーバーエンドポイントからこれらのメトリクスをスクレイピングします。 Kubernetes サービスディスカバリを使用して、Receiver は EKS クラスター内のすべてのワーカーノードを検出できます。したがって、クラスター内のすべてのノードからリソースメトリクスを収集するには、ADOT Collector の複数のインスタンスがあれば十分です。ADOT Collector の単一インスタンスは高負荷時に過負荷になる可能性があるため、常に複数のコレクターをデプロイすることをお勧めします。 メトリクスは、フィルタリング、名前の変更、データの集約と変換などを実行する一連の Processor を通過します。以下は、上記の Amazon EKS 用の ADOT Collector インスタンスのパイプラインで使用される Processor のリストです。 Filter Processor は、名前に基づいてメトリクスを含めるか除外するための AWS OpenTelemetry ディストリビューションの一部です。不要なメトリクスをフィルタリングするために、メトリクス収集パイプラインの一部として使用できます。たとえば、Container Insights でネットワーク関連のメトリクス（名前のプレフィックスが pod_network のもの）を除外し、Pod レベルのメトリクス（名前のプレフィックスが pod_ のもの）のみを収集したい場合があります。 # filter out only renamed metrics which we care about filter: metrics: include: match_type: regexp metric_names: - new_container_.* - pod_.* Metrics Transform Processor は、メトリクスの名前変更、ラベルキーと値の追加、名前変更、削除に使用できます。また、ラベルまたはラベル値全体でメトリクスのスケーリングと集約を実行するためにも使用できます。 metricstransform/rename: transforms: - include: container_spec_cpu_quota new_name: new_container_cpu_limit_raw action: insert match_type: regexp experimental_match_labels: {\"container\": \"\\\\S\"} Cumulative to Delta Processor は、単調増加の累積和とヒストグラムメトリクスを単調増加のデルタメトリクスに変換します。非単調増加の和と指数ヒストグラムは除外されます。 ` # convert cumulative sum datapoints to delta cumulativetodelta: metrics: - pod_cpu_usage_seconds_total - pod_network_rx_errors` Delta to Rate Processor は、デルタ和メトリクスをレートメトリクスに変換します。このレートはゲージです。 ` # convert delta to rate deltatorate: metrics: - pod_memory_hierarchical_pgfault - pod_memory_hierarchical_pgmajfault - pod_network_rx_bytes - pod_network_rx_dropped - pod_network_rx_errors - pod_network_tx_errors - pod_network_tx_packets - new_container_memory_pgfault - new_container_memory_pgmajfault - new_container_memory_hierarchical_pgfault - new_container_memory_hierarchical_pgmajfault` Metrics Generation Processor は、与えられたルールに従って既存のメトリクスを使用して新しいメトリクスを作成するために使用できます。 experimental_metricsgeneration/1: rules: - name: pod_memory_utilization_over_pod_limit unit: Percent type: calculate metric1: pod_memory_working_set metric2: pod_memory_limit operation: percent パイプラインの最後のコンポーネントは AWS CloudWatch EMF Exporter で、メトリクスを埋め込みメトリクスフォーマット (EMF) に変換し、PutLogEvents API を使用して CloudWatch Logs に直接送信します。以下は、Amazon EKS 上で実行されている各ワークロードについて ADOT Collector が CloudWatch に送信するメトリクスのリストです。 pod_cpu_utilization_over_pod_limit pod_cpu_usage_total pod_cpu_limit pod_memory_utilization_over_pod_limit pod_memory_working_set pod_memory_limit pod_network_rx_bytes pod_network_tx_bytes 各メトリクスには以下のディメンションセットが関連付けられ、ContainerInsights という CloudWatch 名前空間の下で収集されます。 ClusterName, LaunchType ClusterName, Namespace, LaunchType ClusterName, Namespace, PodName, LaunchType さらに、ADOT の Container Insights Prometheus サポート および CloudWatch Container Insights を使用して Amazon EKS リソースメトリクスを可視化するための Amazon EKS への ADOT Collector のデプロイ について学習し、Amazon EKS クラスターで ADOT Collector パイプラインをセットアップし、CloudWatch Container Insights で Amazon EKS リソースメトリクスを可視化する方法を確認してください。 また、Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights を使用したコンテナ化アプリケーションの簡単なモニタリング を参照してください。これには、Amazon EKS クラスターの設定、コンテナ化アプリケーションのデプロイ、Container Insights を使用したアプリケーションのパフォーマンスモニタリングに関するステップバイステップの手順が含まれています。 Amazon EKS 向け CloudWatch Container Insights における Fluent Bit の統合​ Fluent Bit は、オープンソースのマルチプラットフォームログプロセッサおよびフォワーダーで、さまざまなソースからデータとログを収集し、それらを統合して CloudWatch Logs を含むさまざまな送信先に送信することができます。また、Docker や Kubernetes 環境とも完全に互換性があります。新しく導入された Fluent Bit デーモンセットを使用することで、EKS クラスターからコンテナログを CloudWatch Logs に送信し、ログの保存と分析を行うことができます。 軽量な特性を活かし、EKS ワーカーノードの Container Insights でデフォルトのログフォワーダーとして Fluent Bit を使用することで、アプリケーションログを効率的かつ確実に CloudWatch Logs にストリーミングできます。Fluent Bit を使用することで、Container Insights は Pod レベルでの CPU とメモリ使用量の面で特に効率的に、数千の重要なビジネスログを大規模に配信することができます。つまり、以前使用されていたログフォワーダーの FluentD と比較して、Fluent Bit はリソースフットプリントが小さく、結果としてメモリと CPU のリソース効率が向上します。一方、Fluent Bit と関連プラグインを含む AWS for Fluent Bit イメージ は、AWS エコシステム内での統一されたエクスペリエンスを提供することを目的としているため、Fluent Bit に新しい AWS 機能をより迅速に採用する柔軟性を追加で提供します。 以下のアーキテクチャは、EKS 向け CloudWatch Container Insights で使用される個々のコンポーネントを示しています： 図：EKS 向け CloudWatch Container Insights で使用される個々のコンポーネント コンテナを扱う際は、Docker JSON ロギングドライバーを使用して、アプリケーションログを含むすべてのログを可能な限り標準出力 (stdout) と標準エラー出力 (stderr) を通じて出力することが推奨されます。このため、EKS ではロギングドライバーがデフォルトで設定されており、コンテナ化されたアプリケーションが stdout または stderr に書き込むすべての内容は、ワーカーノードの \"/var/log/containers\" 配下の JSON ファイルにストリーミングされます。Container Insights は、これらのログをデフォルトで 3 つのカテゴリに分類し、Fluent Bit 内に専用の入力ストリームを作成し、CloudWatch Logs 内に独立したロググループを作成します。これらのカテゴリは以下の通りです： アプリケーションログ：\"/var/log/containers/*.log\" 配下に保存されるすべてのアプリケーションログは、専用の /aws/containerinsights/Cluster_Name/application ロググループにストリーミングされます。kube-proxy や aws-node ログなどの非アプリケーションログは、デフォルトで除外されます。ただし、CoreDNS ログなどの追加の Kubernetes アドオンログも処理され、このロググループにストリーミングされます。 ホストログ：各 EKS ワーカーノードのシステムログは、/aws/containerinsights/Cluster_Name/host ロググループにストリーミングされます。これらのシステムログには、\"/var/log/messages,/var/log/dmesg,/var/log/secure\" ファイルの内容が含まれます。コンテナ化されたワークロードはステートレスで動的な性質を持ち、EKS ワーカーノードはスケーリング活動中に終了されることが多いため、Fluent Bit でこれらのログをリアルタイムにストリーミングし、ノードが終了した後でも CloudWatch Logs でこれらのログを利用できることは、EKS ワーカーノードの可観測性とヘルスモニタリングの観点から重要です。また、多くの場合、ワーカーノードにログインすることなくクラスターの問題をデバッグまたはトラブルシューティングし、これらのログをより体系的に分析することができます。 データプレーンログ：EKS はすでにコントロールプレーンログを提供しています。Container Insights の Fluent Bit 統合により、各ワーカーノードで実行され、実行中の Pod の維持を担当する EKS データプレーンコンポーネントによって生成されるログは、データプレーンログとして取得されます。これらのログも '/aws/containerinsights/Cluster_Name/dataplane' 配下の専用の CloudWatch ロググループにストリーミングされます。kube-proxy、aws-node、Docker ランタイムログがこのロググループに保存されます。コントロールプレーンログに加えて、データプレーンログを CloudWatch Logs に保存することで、EKS クラスターの完全な全体像を提供するのに役立ちます。 さらに、Fluent Bit の設定、Fluent Bit のモニタリング、ログ分析などのトピックについては、Amazon EKS における Fluent Bit の統合 で詳しく学んでください。 Amazon EKS における Container Insights のコスト削減​ デフォルトの設定では、Container Insights レシーバーは レシーバーのドキュメント で定義されている完全なメトリクスセットを収集します。 収集されるメトリクスとディメンションの数は多く、大規模なクラスターでは、メトリクスの取り込みと保存のコストが大幅に増加します。 ここでは、価値のあるメトリクスのみを送信してコストを削減するために、ADOT Collector を設定する 2 つの異なるアプローチを紹介します。 プロセッサーの使用​ このアプローチでは、上記で説明した OpenTelemetry プロセッサーを導入して、メトリクスや属性をフィルタリングし、EMF ログ のサイズを削減します。ここでは、Filter と Resource という 2 つのプロセッサーの基本的な使用方法を説明します。 Filter プロセッサー は、otel-agent-conf という名前の ConfigMap に含めることができます： processors: # filter processors example filter/include: # any names NOT matching filters are excluded from remainder of pipeline metrics: include: match_type: regexp metric_names: # re2 regexp patterns - ^pod_.* filter/exclude: # any names matching filters are excluded from remainder of pipeline metrics: exclude: match_type: regexp metric_names: - ^pod_network.* Resource プロセッサー は AWS OpenTelemetry Distro に組み込まれており、不要なメトリクス属性を削除するために使用できます。たとえば、EMF ログから Kubernetes と Sources フィールドを削除したい場合は、パイプラインに Resource プロセッサーを追加できます： # resource processors example resource: attributes: - key: Sources action: delete - key: kubernetes action: delete メトリクスとディメンションのカスタマイズ​ このアプローチでは、CloudWatch EMF エクスポーターを設定して、CloudWatch Logs に送信したいメトリクスのセットのみを生成します。CloudWatch EMF エクスポーター設定の metric_declaration セクションを使用して、エクスポートしたいメトリクスとディメンションのセットを定義できます。たとえば、デフォルト設定から Pod メトリクスのみを保持できます。この metric_declaration セクションは以下のようになります。また、他のディメンションが不要な場合は、ディメンションセットを [PodName, Namespace, ClusterName] のみに限定してメトリクス数を削減できます： awsemf: namespace: ContainerInsights log_group_name: '/aws/containerinsights/{ClusterName}/performance' log_stream_name: '{NodeName}' resource_to_telemetry_conversion: enabled: true dimension_rollup_option: NoDimensionRollup parse_json_encoded_attr_values: [Sources, kubernetes] # Customized metric declaration section metric_declarations: # pod metrics - dimensions: [[PodName, Namespace, ClusterName]] metric_name_selectors: - pod_cpu_utilization - pod_memory_utilization - pod_cpu_utilization_over_pod_limit - pod_memory_utilization_over_pod_limit この設定により、デフォルト設定の複数のディメンションで 55 の異なるメトリクスを生成する代わりに、単一のディメンション [PodName, Namespace, ClusterName] で以下の 4 つのメトリクスのみを生成してストリーミングします： pod_cpu_utilization pod_memory_utilization pod_cpu_utilization_over_pod_limit pod_memory_utilization_over_pod_limit この設定により、デフォルトで設定されているすべてのメトリクスではなく、関心のあるメトリクスのみを送信できます。その結果、Container Insights のメトリクス取り込みコストを大幅に削減できます。この柔軟性により、Container Insights のお客様はエクスポートされるメトリクスを高度に制御できます。awsemf エクスポーター設定を変更してメトリクスをカスタマイズすることも非常に柔軟で、送信したいメトリクスとそのディメンションの両方をカスタマイズできます。これは CloudWatch に送信されるログにのみ適用されることに注意してください。 上記で説明した 2 つのアプローチは、互いに排他的ではありません。実際、両方を組み合わせることで、監視システムに取り込むメトリクスのカスタマイズに高度な柔軟性を持たせることができます。以下のグラフに示すように、このアプローチを使用してメトリクスの保存と処理に関連するコストを削減します。 図：AWS Cost Explorer 上記の AWS Cost Explorer グラフでは、小規模な EKS クラスター（ワーカーノード 20 個、Pod 220 個）で ADOT Collector の異なる設定を使用した場合の CloudWatch の日次コストを確認できます。8 月 15 日 は、デフォルト設定の ADOT Collector を使用した CloudWatch の請求額を示しています。8 月 16 日 には、EMF エクスポーターのカスタマイズ アプローチを使用し、約 30% のコスト削減が確認できます。8 月 17 日 には、Processors アプローチを使用し、約 45% のコスト削減を達成しています。 Container Insights が送信するメトリクスをカスタマイズすることで、監視対象クラスターの可視性を犠牲にしてモニタリングコストを削減できますが、トレードオフを考慮する必要があります。また、ダッシュボードで使用されるメトリクスとディメンションを送信しないように選択できるため、カスタマイズされたメトリクスは AWS コンソール内の Container Insights が提供する組み込みダッシュボードに影響を与える可能性があります。詳細については、Amazon EKS の Container Insights が送信するメトリクスをカスタマイズすることによるコスト削減 をご確認ください。 EKS Blueprints を使用した Container Insights のセットアップ​ EKS Blueprints は、アカウントやリージョン間で一貫性のある、すぐに使える EKS クラスターを設定およびデプロイするのに役立つ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) モジュールのコレクションです。EKS Blueprints を使用すると、Amazon EKS アドオン や、Prometheus、Karpenter、Nginx、Traefik、AWS Load Balancer Controller、Container Insights、Fluent Bit、Keda、Argo CD などの広く使用されているオープンソースのアドオンを使用して、EKS クラスターを簡単にブートストラップできます。EKS Blueprints は、インフラストラクチャのデプロイを自動化するのに役立つ 2 つの一般的な IaC フレームワーク、HashiCorp Terraform と AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) で実装されています。 EKS Blueprints を使用した Amazon EKS クラスターの作成プロセスの一部として、Container Insights を Day One の運用ツールとしてセットアップし、コンテナ化されたアプリケーションやマイクロサービスからメトリクスとログを収集、集約、要約して Amazon CloudWatch コンソールに送信できます。 まとめ​ オブザーバビリティのベストプラクティスガイドのこのセクションでは、CloudWatch Container Insights について詳しく説明しました。 これには、Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights の紹介と、Amazon EKS 上のコンテナ化されたワークロードを監視する方法が含まれています。

AWS X-Ray を使用したコンテナトレーシング このページの見出し AWS X-Ray を使用したコンテナトレーシング オブザーバビリティのベストプラクティスガイドのこのセクションでは、AWS X-Ray を使用したコンテナトレーシングに関連する以下のトピックについて詳しく説明します： AWS X-Ray の概要 AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry 用の Amazon EKS アドオンを使用したトレース収集 まとめ はじめに​ AWS X-Ray は、アプリケーションが処理するリクエストに関するデータを収集し、そのデータを表示、フィルタリング、分析するためのツールを提供するサービスです。これにより、問題点や最適化の機会を特定することができます。アプリケーションへのトレース対象のリクエストについて、リクエストとレスポンスに関する詳細情報だけでなく、アプリケーションが下流の AWS リソース、マイクロサービス、データベース、Web API に対して行う呼び出しについても確認できます。 アプリケーションのインストルメンテーションには、受信および送信リクエストと、アプリケーション内の他のイベントのトレースデータを、各リクエストのメタデータと共に送信することが含まれます。多くのインストルメンテーションのシナリオでは、設定の変更のみで済みます。たとえば、Java アプリケーションが行うすべての受信 HTTP リクエストと AWS サービスへの下流の呼び出しをインストルメント化できます。X-Ray トレースのためのアプリケーションのインストルメンテーションには、複数の SDK、エージェント、ツールを使用できます。詳細については、アプリケーションのインストルメンテーションをご覧ください。 AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry 用の Amazon EKS アドオンを使用して Amazon EKS クラスターからトレースを収集することで、コンテナ化されたアプリケーションのトレースについて学びます。 AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry 用の Amazon EKS アドオンを使用したトレース収集​ AWS X-Ray はアプリケーショントレース機能を提供し、デプロイされたすべてのマイクロサービスに関する深い洞察を提供します。X-Ray を使用すると、関連するマイクロサービスを通過するすべてのリクエストをトレースできます。これにより、DevOps チームはサービスが他のサービスとどのように相互作用するかを理解し、問題をより迅速に分析およびデバッグするために必要な洞察を得ることができます。 AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) は、OpenTelemetry プロジェクトの安全な AWS サポート対象のディストリビューションです。ユーザーはアプリケーションを一度計装するだけで、ADOT を使用して相関のあるメトリクスとトレースを複数のモニタリングソリューションに送信できます。Amazon EKS では、クラスターの起動後いつでも ADOT をアドオンとして有効にすることができます。ADOT アドオンには最新のセキュリティパッチとバグ修正が含まれており、Amazon EKS での動作が AWS によって検証されています。 ADOT アドオンは、カスタムリソースを使用してアプリケーションとそのコンポーネントを管理する Kubernetes の拡張機能である Kubernetes Operator の実装です。このアドオンは OpenTelemetryCollector という名前のカスタムリソースを監視し、カスタムリソースで指定された設定に基づいて ADOT Collector のライフサイクルを管理します。 ADOT Collector には、Receiver、Processor、Exporter という 3 つの主要なコンポーネントタイプで構成されるパイプラインの概念があります。Receiver は、データがコレクターに取り込まれる方法です。特定の形式でデータを受け入れ、内部形式に変換し、パイプラインで定義された Processors と Exporters に渡します。プル型またはプッシュ型にすることができます。Processor は、受信されてからエクスポートされるまでの間にデータのバッチ処理、フィルタリング、変換などのタスクを実行するためのオプションのコンポーネントです。Exporter は、メトリクス、ログ、またはトレースの送信先を決定するために使用されます。コレクターのアーキテクチャでは、Kubernetes YAML マニフェストを介してこのようなパイプラインの複数のインスタンスを設定できます。 次の図は、トレースパイプラインで構成された ADOT Collector を示しており、テレメトリデータを AWS X-Ray に送信します。トレースパイプラインは、AWS X-Ray Receiver と AWS X-Ray Exporter のインスタンスで構成され、トレースを AWS X-Ray に送信します。 図: AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry 用の Amazon EKS アドオンを使用したトレース収集 ADOT アドオンを EKS クラスターにインストールし、ワークロードからテレメトリデータを収集する詳細を見ていきましょう。以下は、ADOT アドオンをインストールする前に必要な前提条件のリストです。 Kubernetes バージョン 1.19 以上をサポートする EKS クラスター。こちらで説明されているアプローチのいずれかを使用して EKS クラスターを作成できます。 クラスターにまだインストールされていない場合は、Certificate Manager。このドキュメントに従ってデフォルト設定でインストールできます。 クラスターに ADOT アドオンをインストールするための EKS アドオン専用の Kubernetes RBAC 権限。これは、kubectl などの CLI ツールを使用してこの YAMLファイルの設定をクラスターに適用することで実現できます。 次のコマンドを使用して、EKS の異なるバージョンで有効になっているアドオンのリストを確認できます： aws eks describe-addon-versions JSON 出力には、以下のように ADOT アドオンが他のアドオンとともにリストされるはずです。EKS クラスターが作成されたとき、EKS アドオンはそれにアドオンをインストールしないことに注意してください。 { \"addonName\":\"adot\", \"type\":\"observability\", \"addonVersions\":[ { \"addonVersion\":\"v0.45.0-eksbuild.1\", \"architecture\":[ \"amd64\" ], \"compatibilities\":[ { \"clusterVersion\":\"1.22\", \"platformVersions\":[ \"*\" ], \"defaultVersion\":true }, { \"clusterVersion\":\"1.21\", \"platformVersions\":[ \"*\" ], \"defaultVersion\":true }, { \"clusterVersion\":\"1.20\", \"platformVersions\":[ \"*\" ], \"defaultVersion\":true }, { \"clusterVersion\":\"1.19\", \"platformVersions\":[ \"*\" ], \"defaultVersion\":true } ] } ] } 次に、以下のコマンドで ADOT アドオンをインストールできます： aws eks create-addon --addon-name adot --addon-version v0.45.0-eksbuild.1 --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME バージョン文字列は、先ほど表示された出力の addonVersion フィールドの値と一致する必要があります。このコマンドが正常に実行された場合の出力は以下のようになります： { \"addon\": { \"addonName\": \"adot\", \"clusterName\": \"k8s-production-cluster\", \"status\": \"ACTIVE\", \"addonVersion\": \"v0.45.0-eksbuild.1\", \"health\": { \"issues\": [] }, \"addonArn\": \"arn:aws:eks:us-east-1:123456789000:addon/k8s-production-cluster/adot/f0bff97c-0647-ef6f-eecf-0b2a13f7491b\", \"createdAt\": \"2022-04-04T10:36:56.966000+05:30\", \"modifiedAt\": \"2022-04-04T10:38:09.142000+05:30\", \"tags\": {} } } 次のステップに進む前に、アドオンが ACTIVE ステータスになるまで待ちます。アドオンのステータスは以下のコマンドで確認できます： aws eks describe-addon --addon-name adot --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME ADOT Collector のデプロイ​ ADOT アドオンは、Kubernetes Operator の実装です。これは Kubernetes の拡張ソフトウェアで、カスタムリソースを使用してアプリケーションとそのコンポーネントを管理します。このアドオンは OpenTelemetryCollector という名前のカスタムリソースを監視し、カスタムリソースで指定された設定に基づいて ADOT Collector のライフサイクルを管理します。次の図は、この仕組みを示しています。 図: ADOT Collector のデプロイ 次に、ADOT Collector のデプロイ方法を見ていきましょう。こちらの YAML 設定ファイル は、OpenTelemetryCollector カスタムリソースを定義しています。これを EKS クラスターにデプロイすると、ADOT アドオンがトリガーされ、上記の最初の図に示すようなコンポーネントを含むトレースとメトリクスのパイプラインを備えた ADOT Collector がプロビジョニングされます。コレクターは aws-otel-eks 名前空間に ${custom-resource-name}-collector という名前の Kubernetes Deployment としてデプロイされます。同じ名前の ClusterIP サービスも起動されます。このコレクターのパイプラインを構成する個々のコンポーネントを見ていきましょう。 トレースパイプラインの AWS X-Ray Receiver は、X-Ray セグメント形式 のセグメントまたはスパンを受け入れます。これにより、X-Ray SDK で計装されたマイクロサービスから送信されたセグメントを処理できます。UDP ポート 2000 でトラフィックを待ち受けるように設定され、Cluster IP サービスとして公開されます。この設定では、このレシーバーにトレースデータを送信したいワークロードは、環境変数 AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS を observability-collector.aws-otel-eks:2000 に設定する必要があります。エクスポーターは、PutTraceSegments API を使用してこれらのセグメントを直接 X-Ray に送信します。 ADOT Collector は、aws-otel-collector という名前の Kubernetes サービスアカウントの ID で起動するように設定されています。このアカウントには、設定 にも示されているように、ClusterRoleBinding と ClusterRole を使用してこれらの権限が付与されます。エクスポーターは X-Ray にデータを送信するための IAM 権限が必要です。これは、EKS がサポートする サービスアカウント用の IAM ロール 機能を使用して、サービスアカウントを IAM ロールに関連付けることで実現されます。IAM ロールには、AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess などの AWS マネージドポリシーを関連付ける必要があります。こちらのヘルパースクリプト は、CLUSTER_NAME と REGION 変数を設定した後、これらの権限を付与され aws-otel-collector サービスアカウントに関連付けられた EKS-ADOT-ServiceAccount-Role という名前の IAM ロールを作成するために使用できます。 トレース収集のエンドツーエンドテスト​ EKS クラスターにデプロイされたワークロードからのトレース収集をテストしてみましょう。次の図は、このテストで使用されたセットアップを示しています。REST API を公開し S3 と対話するフロントエンドサービスと、Aurora PostgreSQL データベースのインスタンスと対話するデータストアサービスで構成されています。これらのサービスは X-Ray SDK で計装されています。ADOT Collector は、前のセクションで説明した YAML マニフェストを使用して OpenTelemetryCollector カスタムリソースをデプロイすることで、Deployment モードで起動されます。Postman クライアントは、フロントエンドサービスをターゲットとする外部トラフィックジェネレーターとして使用されます。 図：トレース収集のエンドツーエンドテスト 次の画像は、サービスから取得したセグメントデータを使用して X-Ray が生成したサービスグラフを示しており、各セグメントの平均応答レイテンシーを表示しています。 図：CloudWatch Service Map コンソール トレースパイプライン設定に関連する OpenTelemetryCollector カスタムリソース定義については、OTLP Receiver と AWS X-Ray Exporter を使用して AWS X-Ray にトレースを送信するトレースパイプライン を確認してください。AWS X-Ray と共に ADOT Collector を使用したいお客様は、これらの設定テンプレートを出発点として、プレースホルダー変数を対象環境に基づく値に置き換え、ADOT 用の EKS アドオンを使用して Amazon EKS クラスターにコレクターを迅速にデプロイすることができます。 EKS Blueprints を使用した AWS X-Ray によるコンテナトレーシングのセットアップ​ EKS Blueprints

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) の API サーバーのトラブルシューティングを支援するための初期ダッシュボードを、AMP を使用してセットアップします。 これを使用して、本番環境の EKS クラスターのトラブルシューティング時にメトリクスを理解できるようにします。 Amazon EKS クラスターのトラブルシューティング時に、収集されたメトリクスの重要性をより深く理解できるように説明していきます。 まず、ADOT コレクターをセットアップして、Amazon EKS クラスターから Amazon Manager Service for Prometheus にメトリクスを収集します。 このセットアップでは、EKS ADOT アドオンを使用します。これにより、EKS クラスターの起動後いつでも ADOT をアドオンとして有効にすることができます。 ADOT アドオンには、最新のセキュリティパッチとバグ修正が含まれており、Amazon EKS で動作することが AWS によって検証されています。 このセットアップでは、EKS クラスターに ADOT アドオンをインストールし、クラスターからメトリクスを収集する方法を説明します。 次に、最初のステップでセットアップした AMP をデータソースとして使用するために、Amazon Managed Grafana ワークスペースをセットアップします。 最後に、API トラブルシューターダッシュボードをダウンロードし、Amazon Managed Grafana に移動して API トラブルシューター用のダッシュボード JSON をアップロードし、トラブルシューティングのためのメトリクスを可視化します。 API トラブルシューティングダッシュボードを使用した問題の理解​ クラスターにインストールしたい興味深いオープンソースプロジェクトを見つけたとします。 そのオペレーターは、クラスターに DaemonSet をデプロイしますが、不正な形式のリクエストを使用したり、不必要に多くの LIST コールを行ったり、あるいは 1,000 ノードすべてにある DaemonSet が、クラスター上の 50,000 個の Pod のステータスを毎分リクエストしたりする可能性があります！ このようなことは本当によく起こるのでしょうか？はい、実際によく起こります！ このような状況がどのように発生するのか、簡単に見ていきましょう。 LIST と WATCH の理解​ クラスター内のオブジェクトの状態を理解する必要があるアプリケーションがあります。例えば、機械学習 (ML) アプリケーションでは、Completed ステータスになっていない Pod の数を把握することでジョブのステータスを知る必要があります。Kubernetes では、WATCH と呼ばれる適切な方法と、Pod の最新ステータスを確認するためにクラスター上のすべてのオブジェクトをリストアップするという、あまり適切ではない方法があります。 適切な WATCH の使用​ Kubernetes でアップデートを行う最もスケーラブルな方法は、WATCH またはプッシュモデルを介してアップデートを受信する単一の長期接続を使用することです。簡単に説明すると、システムの完全な状態を要求し、そのオブジェクトに対する変更を受信したときにのみキャッシュ内のオブジェクトを更新し、定期的に再同期を実行してアップデートの漏れがないことを確認します。 以下の画像では、apiserver_longrunning_gauge を使用して、両方の API サーバーにおけるこれらの長期接続の数を把握しています。 図: apiserver_longrunning_gauge メトリクス このような効率的なシステムでも、良いものを使いすぎることがあります。たとえば、API サーバーと通信する必要がある 2 つ以上の DaemonSet を使用する非常に小さなノードを多数使用する場合、システムの WATCH 呼び出しの数が不必要に大幅に増加する可能性があります。例として、8 つの xlarge ノードと 1 つの 8xlarge ノードの違いを見てみましょう。ここでは、システムの WATCH 呼び出しが 8 倍に増加しているのが分かります。 図: 8 つの xlarge ノード間の WATCH 呼び出し これらは効率的な呼び出しですが、もし先ほど言及した不適切な呼び出しだったらどうでしょうか？1,000 個のノードそれぞれの上記の DaemonSet の 1 つが、クラスター内の合計 50,000 個の Pod それぞれのアップデートを要求していると想像してみてください。次のセクションでは、この無制限のリスト呼び出しについて詳しく見ていきます。 続ける前に注意点があります。上記の例のような統合は細心の注意を払って行う必要があり、多くの要因を考慮する必要があります。システムの限られた数の CPU を争う多数のスレッドの遅延、Pod の変更率、ノードが安全に処理できるボリュームアタッチメントの最大数など、すべてが関係します。しかし、私たちの焦点は、問題の発生を防ぎ、場合によっては設計に新しい洞察を与えてくれる実行可能なステップにつながるメトリクスに置かれます。 WATCH メトリクスはシンプルですが、WATCH の数を追跡し、それが問題である場合は削減するために使用できます。以下は、この数を減らすために検討できるいくつかのオプションです： Helm が履歴を追跡するために作成する ConfigMap の数を制限する WATCH を使用しないイミュータブルな ConfigMap とシークレットを使用する 適切なノードのサイジングと統合 API サーバーへの無制限のリストコールについて​ これまで話してきた LIST コールについて説明します。リストコールは、オブジェクトの状態を理解する必要がある度に、Kubernetes オブジェクトの完全な履歴を取得します。この場合、キャッシュには何も保存されません。 これはどの程度の影響があるのでしょうか？これは、データをリクエストするエージェントの数、リクエストの頻度、リクエストするデータ量によって異なります。クラスター全体のデータを要求しているのか、それとも単一の名前空間だけなのでしょうか？それは毎分、すべてのノードで発生しているのでしょうか？例として、ノードから送信される各ログに Kubernetes のメタデータを追加するロギングエージェントを考えてみましょう。これは、大規模なクラスターでは膨大な量のデータになる可能性があります。エージェントがリストコールを通じてそのデータを取得する方法は多数ありますので、いくつか見てみましょう。 以下のリクエストは、特定の名前空間からポッドを要求しています。 /api/v1/namespaces/my-namespace/pods 次に、クラスター上の 50,000 個のポッドすべてを、一度に 500 個ずつのチャンクで要求します。 /api/v1/pods?limit=500 次のコールは最も破壊的です。クラスター全体の 50,000 個のポッドを一度に取得します。 /api/v1/pods これは現場で頻繁に発生し、ログで確認することができます。 API サーバーの不適切な動作を停止する​ クラスターをこのような不適切な動作から保護するにはどうすればよいでしょうか？Kubernetes 1.20 以前では、API サーバーは 1 秒あたりに処理される インフライト リクエストの数を制限することで自身を保護していました。etcd は一度に処理できるリクエスト数に限りがあるため、etcd の読み取りと書き込みを適切なレイテンシー範囲内に保つために、1 秒あたりのリクエスト数を制限する必要があります。残念ながら、この記事の執筆時点では、これを動的に行う方法はありません。 以下のチャートでは、読み取りリクエストの内訳を示しています。API サーバーあたりのインフライトリクエストのデフォルトの上限は 400、同時書き込みリクエストのデフォルトの上限は 200 です。デフォルトの EKS クラスターでは、2 つの API サーバーがあり、合計で 800 の読み取りと 400 の書き込みが可能です。ただし、アップグレード直後などの特定の時期には、これらのサーバーに非対称な負荷がかかる可能性があるため、注意が必要です。 図：読み取りリクエストの内訳を示す Grafana チャート 上記の方式は完璧ではないことが判明しました。例えば、新しくインストールした不適切な動作をするオペレーターが API サーバーのインフライト書き込みリクエストをすべて使用し、ノードのキープアライブメッセージなどの重要なリクエストを遅延させる可能性があるのを、どのように防ぐことができるでしょうか？ API の優先順位と公平性​ 1 秒あたりの読み取り/書き込みリクエストの数を気にするのではなく、キャパシティを 1 つの合計数として扱い、クラスター上の各アプリケーションがその最大合計数の公平な割合を取得するとしたらどうでしょうか？ これを効果的に行うには、API サーバーにリクエストを送信した送信者を特定し、そのリクエストに名前タグのようなものを付ける必要があります。この新しい名前タグを使用して、これらのリクエストがすべて \"Chatty\" と呼ばれる新しいエージェントから送信されていることを確認できます。これにより、Chatty のすべてのリクエストを、同じ DaemonSet からのリクエストを識別する フロー と呼ばれるものにグループ化できます。この概念により、この問題のあるエージェントを制限し、クラスター全体を消費しないようにする機能が得られます。 ただし、すべてのリクエストが同等というわけではありません。クラスターの運用に必要なコントロールプレーントラフィックは、新しいオペレーターよりも優先順位が高くなければなりません。ここで優先順位レベルの考え方が登場します。デフォルトで、重要、高、低優先度のトラフィック用に複数の「バケット」またはキューがあったらどうでしょうか？ Chatty エージェントフローが重要なトラフィックキューで公平なシェアを得ることは望ましくありません。ただし、そのトラフィックを低優先度キューに入れることで、そのフローが他の Chatty エージェントと競合するようにすることができます。その後、各優先順位レベルに、リクエストが過度に遅延しないように、API サーバーが処理できる全体の最大値の適切な数のシェアまたは割合があることを確認する必要があります。 優先順位とフェアネスの動作​ これは比較的新しい機能であるため、多くの既存のダッシュボードでは、最大同時読み取りと最大同時書き込みの古いモデルを使用しています。なぜこれが問題になる可能性があるのでしょうか？ kube-system 名前空間のすべてに高優先度の名前タグを付与していたとしても、その重要な名前空間に問題のあるエージェントをインストールしたり、単にその名前空間に多くのアプリケーションをデプロイしすぎたりした場合はどうなるでしょうか？避けようとしていた問題と同じ状況に陥る可能性があります！そのため、このような状況を注意深く監視することが重要です。 このような問題を追跡するために、私が最も重要だと考えるメトリクスをいくつか紹介します。 優先度グループのシェアの何パーセントが使用されているか？ リクエストがキューで待機した最長時間は？ どのフローが最もシェアを使用しているか？ システムに予期しない遅延はあるか？ 使用率​ ここでは、クラスターの異なるデフォルトの優先度グループと、最大値に対する使用率の割合を確認できます。 図：クラスターの優先度グループ リクエストがキューに入っていた時間​ リクエストが処理される前に、優先度キューで待機していた時間を秒単位で示します。 図: リクエストが優先度キューに入っていた時間 フローごとの実行リクエスト数の上位​ どのフローが最も多くのシェアを占めているでしょうか？ 図: フローごとの実行リクエスト数の上位 リクエスト実行時間​ 処理に予期しない遅延はありませんか？ 図: フロー制御リクエスト実行時間 最も遅い API コールと API サーバーのレイテンシーの問題を特定する​ API レイテンシーの原因について理解できたので、全体像を見てみましょう。 ダッシュボードの設計は、調査が必要な問題の有無を素早く把握することが目的であることを覚えておくことが重要です。 詳細な分析には、PromQL を使用したアドホッククエリ、あるいはさらに良い方法として、ログクエリを使用します。 高レベルのメトリクスとして、どのような指標を確認すべきでしょうか？ どの API コールが最も時間がかかっているか？ そのコールは何をしているのか？（オブジェクトの一覧表示、削除など） どのオブジェクトに対してその操作を実行しようとしているのか？（Pod、Secret、ConfigMap など） API サーバー自体にレイテンシーの問題があるか？ プライオリティキューの 1 つに遅延があり、リクエストのバックアップが発生しているか？ etcd サーバーがレイテンシーを経験しているために、API サーバーが遅く見えるだけなのか？ 最も遅い API コール​ 以下のグラフでは、その期間で完了までに最も時間がかかった API コールを確認しています。 この場合、カスタムリソース定義 (CRD) が LIST 関数を呼び出しており、05:40 の時間枠で最も遅延が大きいコールであることがわかります。 このデータを基に、CloudWatch Insights を使用して、その時間枠の監査ログから LIST リクエストを抽出し、どのアプリケーションが原因である可能性があるかを確認できます。 図: 最も遅い上位 5 つの API コール API リクエスト時間​ この API レイテンシーチャートは、リクエストが 1 分のタイムアウト値に近づいているかどうかを理解するのに役立ちます。以下の時系列ヒストグラムは、折れ線グラフでは隠れてしまう外れ値を確認できるため、好ましい形式です。 図: API リクエスト時間のヒートマップ バケットにカーソルを合わせるだけで、約 25 ミリ秒かかった呼び出しの正確な数を確認できます。 [Image: Image.jpg]図: 25 ミリ秒を超える呼び出し このコンセプトは、リクエストをキャッシュする他のシステムと連携する際に重要です。キャッシュされたリクエストは高速になります。キャッシュされたリクエストのレイテンシーを、より遅いリクエストと混ぜたくありません。ここでは、2 つの異なるレイテンシーバンドを確認できます。キャッシュされたリクエストと、されていないリクエストです。 図: レイテンシー、キャッシュされたリクエスト ETCD リクエスト時間​ ETCD のレイテンシーは、Kubernetes のパフォーマンスにおいて最も重要な要素の 1 つです。 Amazon EKS では、request_duration_seconds_bucket メトリクスを確認することで、API サーバーの視点からこのパフォーマンスを確認できます。 図: request_duration_seconds_bucket メトリクス これまでに学んだことを組み合わせて、特定のイベントに相関関係があるかどうかを確認できます。 以下のチャートでは、API サーバーのレイテンシーを確認できますが、このレイテンシーの多くが etcd サーバーから発生していることがわかります。 一目で適切な問題領域にすばやく移動できることが、ダッシュボードの強力な機能です。 図: Etcd リクエスト まとめ​

ログ集約 オブザーバビリティのベストプラクティスガイドのこのセクションでは、AWS ネイティブサービスを使用した Amazon EKS ロギングに関連する以下のトピックについて詳しく説明します： Amazon EKS ロギングの概要 Amazon EKS コントロールプレーンのロギング Amazon EKS データプレーンのロギング Amazon EKS アプリケーションのロギング AWS ネイティブサービスを使用した Amazon EKS と他のコンピューティングプラットフォームからの統合ログ集約 まとめ はじめに​ Amazon EKS のログは、コントロールプレーンのログ、ノードのログ、アプリケーションのログの 3 つのタイプに分類できます。Kubernetes コントロールプレーン は、Kubernetes クラスターを管理し、監査と診断目的のログを生成するコンポーネントのセットです。Amazon EKS では、異なるコントロールプレーンコンポーネントのログを有効化し、CloudWatch に送信できます。 Kubernetes は、Pod を実行する各 Kubernetes ノードで kubelet や kube-proxy などのシステムコンポーネントも実行します。これらのコンポーネントは各ノード内にログを書き込み、CloudWatch と Container Insights を設定して各 Amazon EKS ノードのログを取得できます。 コンテナは Kubernetes クラスター内で Pod としてグループ化され、Kubernetes ノードで実行されるようにスケジュールされます。ほとんどのコンテナ化されたアプリケーションは標準出力と標準エラーに書き込みを行い、コンテナエンジンはその出力をログドライバーにリダイレクトします。Kubernetes では、コンテナログはノードの /var/log/pods ディレクトリにあります。CloudWatch と Container Insights を設定して、各 Amazon EKS Pod のログを取得できます。 Kubernetes でコンテナログを集中ログ集約システムに送信する一般的なアプローチには、以下の 3 つがあります： Fluentd DaemonSet のようなノードレベルのエージェント。これが推奨パターンです。 Fluentd サイドカーコンテナのようなサイドカーコンテナ。 ログ収集システムへの直接書き込み。このアプローチでは、アプリケーションがログの送信を担当します。これは最も推奨されないオプションです。なぜなら、Fluentd のようなコミュニティが構築したソリューションを再利用する代わりに、アプリケーションコードにログ集約システムの SDK を含める必要があるためです。このパターンは、関心の分離 の原則にも反します。この原則によれば、ログの実装はアプリケーションから独立しているべきです。これにより、アプリケーションに影響を与えたり変更したりすることなく、ログインフラストラクチャを変更できます。 これから、Amazon EKS ログの各カテゴリについて詳しく見ていき、Amazon EKS と他のコンピューティングプラットフォームからの統合ログ集約についても説明します。 Amazon EKS コントロールプレーンのロギング​ Amazon EKS クラスターは、Kubernetes クラスター用の高可用性のシングルテナントコントロールプレーンと、コンテナを実行する Amazon EKS ノードで構成されています。 コントロールプレーンノードは AWS が管理するアカウントで実行されます。 Amazon EKS クラスターのコントロールプレーンノードは CloudWatch と統合されており、特定のコントロールプレーンコンポーネントのロギングを有効にすることができます。 各 Kubernetes コントロールプレーンコンポーネントインスタンスのログが提供されます。 AWS はコントロールプレーンノードの健全性を管理し、Kubernetes エンドポイントのサービスレベルアグリーメント (SLA) を提供します。 Amazon EKS コントロールプレーンのロギング は、以下のクラスターコントロールプレーンのログタイプで構成されています。 各ログタイプは、Kubernetes コントロールプレーンのコンポーネントに対応しています。 これらのコンポーネントの詳細については、Kubernetes ドキュメントの Kubernetes Components を参照してください。 API サーバー (api) – クラスターの API サーバーは、Kubernetes API を公開するコントロールプレーンコンポーネントです。クラスター起動時またはその直後に API サーバーのログを有効にすると、API サーバーの起動に使用されたフラグがログに含まれます。詳細については、Kubernetes ドキュメントの kube-apiserver と 監査ポリシー を参照してください。 監査 (audit) – Kubernetes 監査ログは、クラスターに影響を与えた個々のユーザー、管理者、またはシステムコンポーネントの記録を提供します。詳細については、Kubernetes ドキュメントの Auditing を参照してください。 認証機能 (authenticator) – 認証機能のログは Amazon EKS 固有のものです。これらのログは、IAM 認証情報を使用して Kubernetes の ロールベースアクセス制御 (RBAC) 認証を行うために Amazon EKS が使用するコントロールプレーンコンポーネントを表します。詳細については、クラスター管理 を参照してください。 コントローラーマネージャー (controllerManager) – コントローラーマネージャーは、Kubernetes に付属するコアコントロールループを管理します。詳細については、Kubernetes ドキュメントの kube-controller-manager を参照してください。 スケジューラー (scheduler) – スケジューラーコンポーネントは、クラスター内の Pod をいつどこで実行するかを管理します。詳細については、Kubernetes ドキュメントの kube-scheduler を参照してください。 コントロールプレーンログの有効化と無効化 のセクションに従って、AWS コンソールまたは AWS CLI を使用してコントロールプレーンログを有効にしてください。 CloudWatch コンソールからコントロールプレーンログを照会する​ Amazon EKS クラスターでコントロールプレーンのログ記録を有効にすると、/aws/eks/cluster-name/cluster ロググループで EKS コントロールプレーンログを確認できます。詳細については、クラスターコントロールプレーンログの表示 を参照してください。cluster-name をクラスターの名前に置き換えてください。 CloudWatch Logs Insights を使用して、EKS コントロールプレーンのログデータを検索できます。詳細については、CloudWatch Insights を使用したログデータの分析 を参照してください。重要な点として、クラスターでコントロールプレーンのログ記録を有効にした後でのみ、CloudWatch Logs でログイベントを表示できます。CloudWatch Logs Insights でクエリを実行する時間範囲を選択する前に、コントロールプレーンのログ記録が有効になっていることを確認してください。以下のスクリーンショットは、クエリ出力を含む EKS コントロールプレーンログのクエリ例を示しています。 図: CloudWatch Logs Insights CloudWatch Logs Insights での一般的な EKS ユースケースのサンプルクエリ​ クラスター作成者を見つけるには、kubernetes-admin ユーザーにマッピングされている IAM エンティティを検索します。 fields @logStream,

Amazon EKS Control Plane Logs についてさらに学ぶことを強くお勧めします。 Amazon EKS データプレーンのロギング​ Amazon EKS のログとメトリクスを取得するには、CloudWatch Container Insights の使用をお勧めします。Container Insights は、CloudWatch エージェントを使用してクラスター、ノード、Pod レベルのメトリクスを実装し、Fluent Bit または Fluentd を使用して CloudWatch にログを取得します。Container Insights は、取得した CloudWatch メトリクスの階層化されたビューを持つ自動ダッシュボードも提供します。Container Insights は、すべての Amazon EKS ノードで実行される CloudWatch DaemonSet と Fluent Bit DaemonSet としてデプロイされます。Fargate ノードは AWS によって管理され、DaemonSet をサポートしていないため、Container Insights ではサポートされていません。Amazon EKS の Fargate ロギングについては、このガイドで別途説明します。 以下の表は、Amazon EKS のデフォルトの Fluentd または Fluent Bit ログ取得設定によって取得される CloudWatch ロググループとログを示しています。 /aws/containerinsights/Cluster_Name/host /var/log/dmesg、/var/log/secure、/var/log/messages からのログ /aws/containerinsights/Cluster_Name/dataplane kubelet.service、kubeproxy.service、docker.service の /var/log/journal 内のログ ロギングに Container Insights と Fluent Bit または Fluentd を使用したくない場合は、Amazon EKS ノードにインストールされた CloudWatch エージェントを使用してノードとコンテナのログを取得できます。Amazon EKS ノードは EC2 インスタンスであるため、Amazon EC2 の標準的なシステムレベルのロギングアプローチに含める必要があります。Distributor と State Manager を使用して CloudWatch エージェントをインストールする場合、Amazon EKS ノードも CloudWatch エージェントのインストール、設定、更新に含まれます。以下の表は、ロギングに Container Insights と Fluent Bit または Fluentd を使用していない場合に取得する必要がある Kubernetes 固有のログを示しています。 var/log/aws-routed-eni/ipamd.log``/var/log/aws-routed-eni/plugin.log L-IPAM デーモンのログはここにあります データプレーンのロギングについて詳しくは、Amazon EKS ノードロギングのプリスクリプティブガイダンスを参照してください。 Amazon EKS アプリケーションログ​ Kubernetes 環境でアプリケーションを大規模に実行する場合、Amazon EKS アプリケーションログは不可欠となります。アプリケーションログを収集するには、Fluent Bit、Fluentd、または CloudWatch Container Insights などのログアグリゲータを Amazon EKS クラスターにインストールする必要があります。 Fluent Bit は C++ で書かれたオープンソースのログプロセッサおよびフォワーダーで、さまざまなソースからデータを収集し、フィルターで強化して、複数の出力先に送信できます。このガイドのソリューションを使用することで、ログ記録のために aws-for-fluent-bit または fargate-fluentbit を有効にできます。Fluentd は、統合ログ層用のオープンソースデータコレクターで、Ruby で書かれています。Fluentd は統合ログ層として機能し、複数のソースからデータを集約し、異なる形式のデータを JSON 形式のオブジェクトに統合し、異なる出力先にルーティングできます。何千台ものサーバーを監視する場合、CPU とメモリの使用率の観点からログコレクターの選択は重要です。複数の Amazon EKS クラスターがある場合、Fluent Bit を軽量なシッパーとして使用して、クラスター内の異なるノードからデータを収集し、Fluentd に転送して集約、処理、サポートされている出力先へのルーティングを行うことができます。 アプリケーションとクラスターのログを CloudWatch に送信するログコレクターおよびフォワーダーとして、Fluent Bit の使用をお勧めします。その後、CloudWatch のサブスクリプションフィルターを使用して、ログを Amazon OpenSearch Service にストリーミングできます。このオプションは、このセクションのアーキテクチャ図に示されています。 図：Amazon EKS アプリケーションログのアーキテクチャ この図は、Amazon EKS クラスターからのアプリケーションログが Amazon OpenSearch Service にストリーミングされる際のワークフローを示しています。Amazon EKS クラスター内の Fluent Bit サービスが CloudWatch にログをプッシュします。AWS Lambda 関数がサブスクリプションフィルターを使用して、ログを Amazon OpenSearch Service にストリーミングします。その後、Kibana を使用して設定されたインデックス内のログを可視化できます。また、Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose を使用してログをストリーミングし、Amazon Athena での分析とクエリのために S3 バケットに保存することもできます。 ほとんどのクラスターでは、ログ集約に Fluentd や Fluent Bit を使用する場合、最適化はほとんど必要ありません。しかし、何千もの Pod とノードを持つ大規模なクラスターを扱う場合は状況が変わります。何千もの Pod を持つクラスターにおける Fluentd と Fluent Bit の影響 に関する調査結果を公開しています。さらに学習を深めるために、Use_Kubelet オプションを使用して Kubernetes API サーバーへの API コール量を削減するように設計された Fluent Bit の拡張機能 についてもご確認いただくことをお勧めします。この Fluent Bit の Use_Kubelet 機能により、ホスト上の kubelet から Pod のメタデータを取得できます。Amazon EKS のお客様は、この機能を有効にすることで、Kubernetes API サーバーに過負荷をかけることなく、数万の Pod を実行するクラスターでログをキャプチャするために Fluent Bit を使用できます。大規模な Kubernetes クラスターを実行していない場合でも、この機能を有効にすることをお勧めします。 Fargate での Amazon EKS のロギング​ Fargate での Amazon EKS を使用すると、Kubernetes ノードを割り当てたり管理したりすることなく Pod をデプロイできます。これにより、Kubernetes ノードのシステムレベルのログを取得する必要がなくなります。Fargate Pod からログを取得するには、Fluent Bit を使用して直接 CloudWatch にログを転送できます。これにより、追加の設定や Fargate 上の Amazon EKS Pod 用のサイドカーコンテナを必要とせずに、自動的にログを CloudWatch にルーティングできます。詳細については、Amazon EKS ドキュメントの Fargate ロギング と AWS ブログの Amazon EKS 用 Fluent Bit を参照してください。このソリューションは、コンテナの STDOUT と STDERR の入出力 (I/O) ストリームを取得し、Fargate 上の Amazon EKS クラスターに設定された Fluent Bit の構成に基づいて CloudWatch に送信します。 Amazon EKS 用の Fluent Bit サポートにより、Fargate で実行されている Amazon EKS Pod からコンテナログをルーティングするためのサイドカーを実行する必要がなくなりました。新しい組み込みのロギングサポートにより、レコードを送信する宛先を自由に選択できます。Fargate での Amazon EKS は、AWS が管理する Fluent Bit のアップストリーム準拠ディストリビューションである AWS 用 Fluent Bit のバージョンを使用します。 図: Fargate での Amazon EKS のロギング Amazon EKS の Fluent Bit サポートについて詳しくは、Amazon EKS ドキュメントの Fargate ロギング を参照してください。 AWS Fargate で実行される Pod で、サイドカーパターンを使用する必要がある場合があります。アプリケーションが生成するログを取得するために、Fluentd（または Fluent Bit）サイドカーコンテナを実行できます。このオプションでは、アプリケーションが stdout や stderr ではなくファイルシステムにログを書き込む必要があります。このアプローチの結果として、kubectl ログを使用してコンテナログを表示することはできません。kubectl logs でログを表示するには、アプリケーションログを stdout とファイルシステムの両方に同時に書き込むことができます。 Fargate の Pod には 20GB の一時ストレージが提供され、Pod に属するすべてのコンテナで利用できます。アプリケーションをローカルファイルシステムにログを書き込むように設定し、Fluentd にログディレクトリ（またはファイル）を監視するように指示できます。Fluentd はログファイルの末尾からイベントを読み取り、保存のために CloudWatch などの宛先にイベントを送信します。ログがボリューム全体を占有しないように、定期的にログをローテーションするようにしてください。 AWS Fargate で Kubernetes アプリケーションを大規模に運用・監視する方法については、AWS Fargate での Amazon EKS 使用時のアプリケーションログの取得方法 をご覧ください。このアプローチでは、tee を使用してファイルと stdout の両方に書き込み、kubectl logs でログを確認することもできます。 AWS ネイティブサービスを使用した Amazon EKS および他のコンピューティングプラットフォームからの統合ログ集約​ 現在、お客様はエージェント、ログルーター、拡張機能を使用して、Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)、Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)、Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)、Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose、AWS Lambda などの異なるコンピューティングプラットフォーム全体でログを統合および一元化することを望んでいます。 そして、Amazon OpenSearch Service と OpenSearch Dashboards を使用して、異なるコンピューティングプラットフォーム全体で収集されたログを視覚化および分析し、アプリケーションのインサイトを得ることができます。 統合されたログ集約システムには、以下のメリットがあります： 異なるコンピューティングプラットフォーム全体のログへの単一のアクセスポイント Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)、Amazon OpenSearch Service、Amazon Redshift などのダウンストリームシステムに配信される前のログ変換の定義と標準化をサポート Amazon OpenSearch Service を使用して素早くインデックスを作成し、OpenSearch Dashboards を使用してルーター、アプリケーション、その他のデバイスからのログを検索および視覚化する機能 次の図は、Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)、Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)、Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)、AWS Lambda などの異なるコンピューティングプラットフォーム全体でログ集約を実行するアーキテクチャを示しています。 図：異なるコンピューティングプラットフォーム全体でのログ集約 このアーキテクチャでは、ログエージェント、ログルーター、Lambda 拡張機能などの様々なログ集約ツールを使用して、複数のコンピューティングプラットフォームからログを収集し、Kinesis Data Firehose に配信します。 Kinesis Data Firehose は、ログを Amazon OpenSearch Service にストリーミングします。 Amazon OpenSearch Service への永続化に失敗したログレコードは AWS S3 に書き込まれます。 このアーキテクチャをスケールするために、各コンピューティングプラットフォームは異なる Firehose 配信ストリームにログをストリーミングし、別個のインデックスとして追加され、24 時間ごとにローテーションされます。 さらに学習を深めるには、Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)、Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)、Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)、AWS Lambda などの異なるコンピューティングプラットフォーム全体でログを統合および一元化する方法について確認してください。 このアプローチにより、異なるサービスに異なるプラットフォームを使用するのではなく、単一のプラットフォームを使用してログを素早く分析し、障害の根本原因を特定することができます。 まとめ​

OpenTelemetry を使用した ECS クラスターでのシステムメトリクスの収集 このページの見出し AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry を使用した ECS クラスターでのシステムメトリクスの収集 AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) は、OpenTelemetry プロジェクトの AWS がサポートするセキュアなディストリビューションです。ADOT を使用することで、複数のソースからテレメトリーデータを収集し、関連付けられたメトリクス、トレース、ログを複数のモニタリングソリューションに送信できます。ADOT は Amazon ECS クラスターに 2 つの異なるパターンでデプロイできます。 ADOT Collector のデプロイパターン​ サイドカーパターンでは、ADOT Collector がクラスター内の各タスク内で実行され、そのタスク内のアプリケーションコンテナから収集されたテレメトリデータのみを処理します。このデプロイパターンは、Collector が Amazon ECS Task Metadata Endpoint からタスクメタデータを読み取り、CPU、メモリ、ネットワーク、ディスクなどのリソース使用量メトリクスを生成する必要がある場合にのみ必要です。 セントラルコレクターパターンでは、ADOT Collector の単一インスタンスがクラスターにデプロイされ、クラスター上で実行されているすべてのタスクからのテレメトリデータを処理します。これは最も一般的に使用されるデプロイパターンです。Collector は REPLICA または DAEMON サービススケジューラー戦略を使用してデプロイされます。 ADOT Collector のアーキテクチャにはパイプラインの概念があります。1 つの Collector に複数のパイプラインを含めることができます。各パイプラインは、メトリクス、トレース、ログという 3 種類のテレメトリデータのいずれかを処理することに専念します。各種類のテレメトリデータに対して複数のパイプラインを設定できます。この汎用性のあるアーキテクチャにより、1 つの Collector が、クラスターに個別にデプロイする必要がある複数のオブザーバビリティエージェントの役割を果たすことができます。これにより、クラスター上のオブザーバビリティエージェントのデプロイメントフットプリントが大幅に削減されます。パイプラインを構成する Collector の主要コンポーネントは、Receivers、Processors、Exporters の 3 つのカテゴリーに分類されます。Extensions と呼ばれる二次的なコンポーネントもあり、これらは Collector に追加できる機能を提供しますが、パイプラインの一部ではありません。 備考 Receivers、Processors、Exporters、Extensions の詳細な説明については、OpenTelemetry のドキュメントを参照してください。 ECS タスクメトリクス収集のための ADOT Collector のデプロイ​ ECS タスクレベルでリソース使用率メトリクスを収集するには、以下のようなタスク定義を使用して、サイドカーパターンで ADOT Collector をデプロイする必要があります。 Collector に使用されるコンテナイメージには、複数のパイプライン設定が同梱されています。 要件に応じてそれらの中から 1 つを選択し、コンテナ定義の command セクションで設定ファイルのパスを指定できます。 この値を --config=/etc/ecs/container-insights/otel-task-metrics-config.yaml に設定すると、パイプライン設定 が使用され、Collector と同じタスク内で実行されている他のコンテナからリソース使用率メトリクスとトレースを収集し、Amazon CloudWatch と AWS X-Ray に送信します。 具体的には、Collector は AWS ECS Container Metrics Receiver を使用して、Amazon ECS タスクメタデータエンドポイント からタスクメタデータと Docker の統計情報を読み取り、それらから CPU、メモリ、ネットワーク、ディスクなどのリソース使用率メトリクスを生成します。 { \"family\":\"AdotTask\", \"taskRoleArn\":\"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ECS-ADOT-Task-Role\",

コンテナエージェントのバージョン を参照してください。 デフォルトの パイプライン設定 に示されているように、Collector のパイプラインはまず Filter Processor を使用して、CPU、メモリ、ネットワーク、ディスク使用率に関する メトリクスのサブセット をフィルタリングします。 次に、Metrics Transform Processor を使用して、一連の 変換 を実行し、これらのメトリクスの名前を変更し、属性を更新します。 最後に、Amazon CloudWatch EMF Exporter を使用してパフォーマンスログイベントとして CloudWatch にメトリクスを送信します。 このデフォルト設定を使用すると、CloudWatch 名前空間 ECS/ContainerInsights で以下のリソース使用率メトリクスが収集されます。 MemoryUtilized MemoryReserved CpuUtilized CpuReserved NetworkRxBytes NetworkTxBytes StorageReadBytes StorageWriteBytes 備考 これらは Container Insights for Amazon ECS で収集されるメトリクス と同じであり、クラスターまたはアカウントレベルで Container Insights を有効にすると CloudWatch ですぐに利用できることに注意してください。 したがって、CloudWatch で ECS リソース使用率メトリクスを収集するには、Container Insights を有効にすることが推奨されるアプローチです。 AWS ECS Container Metrics Receiver は、Amazon ECS タスクメタデータエンドポイントから読み取る 52 の固有のメトリクスを出力します。 レシーバーが収集するメトリクスの完全なリストは こちらにドキュメント化 されています。 これらすべてを希望の送信先に送信したくない場合があります。 ECS リソース使用率メトリクスをより明示的に制御したい場合は、カスタムパイプライン設定を作成し、選択したプロセッサー/トランスフォーマーで利用可能なメトリクスをフィルタリングおよび変換し、選択したエクスポーターに基づいて送信先に送信できます。 ECS タスクレベルのメトリクスを取得するためのパイプライン設定の 追加の例 については、ドキュメントを参照してください。 カスタムパイプライン設定を使用する場合は、以下のタスク定義を使用して、サイドカーパターンで Collector をデプロイできます。 ここでは、Collector パイプラインの設定は AWS SSM Parameter Store の otel-collector-config という名前のパラメータから読み込まれます。 注記 SSM Parameter Store

メトリクスを収集できます。 このレシーバーは、Prometheus サーバーの最小限の代替として機能することを目的としています。 このレシーバーでメトリクスを収集するには、スクレイピング対象のサービスセットを検出するメカニズムが必要です。 レシーバーは、数十種類のサービスディスカバリメカニズムのいずれかを使用して、スクレイピングターゲットの静的および動的な検出をサポートしています。 Amazon ECS には組み込みのサービスディスカバリメカニズムがないため、コレクターはファイルベースのターゲット検出に対する Prometheus のサポートに依存しています。 ファイルベースのターゲット検出のために Prometheus レシーバーを設定するために、コレクターは Amazon ECS Observer 拡張機能を使用します。 この拡張機能は ECS/EC2 API

コレクターコンテナにマウントされたファイルシステム上に存在します。 その後、Prometheus レシーバーはこのファイルにリストされているターゲットからメトリクスをスクレイプします。 Amazon Managed Prometheus ワークスペースへのメトリクスデータの送信​ Prometheus Receiver によって収集されたメトリクスは、以下の設定の exporters セクションに示すように、コレクターパイプラインの Prometheus Remote Write Exporter を使用して Amazon Managed Prometheus ワークスペースに送信できます。エクスポーターはワークスペースのリモートライト URL で設定され、HTTP POST リクエストを使用してメトリクスデータを送信します。ワークスペースに送信されるリクエストに署名するために、組み込みの AWS Signature Version 4 認証を使用します。 extensions: health_check: sigv4auth: region: us-east-1 ecs_observer: refresh_interval: 60s cluster_name:

オブザーバビリティ : 重要なメトリクス このページの見出し EKS オブザーバビリティ : 重要なメトリクス 現状の概要 モニタリングとは、インフラストラクチャとアプリケーションの所有者が、システムの過去と現在の状態を把握し理解するための手段として定義されます。これは、定義されたメトリクスやログの収集に重点を置いています。 モニタリングは長年にわたって進化してきました。 最初は、デバッグとトラブルシューティングのためのデバッグログやダンプログから始まり、syslog や top などのコマンドラインツールを使用した基本的なモニタリングへと進化し、さらにダッシュボードでの可視化が可能になりました。 クラウドの出現と規模の拡大により、現在では過去に比べてより多くの要素を追跡しています。 業界はオブザーバビリティへとシフトしており、これはインフラストラクチャとアプリケーションの所有者が積極的にシステムのトラブルシューティングとデバッグを行うためのソリューションとして定義されています。 オブザーバビリティは、メトリクスから導き出されるパターンの分析により重点を置いています。 メトリクス、なぜ重要なのか？ メトリクスは、作成された時間順に保持される一連の数値データです。 環境内のサーバー数、ディスク使用量、1 秒あたりの処理リクエスト数、リクエストの完了までの遅延時間など、あらゆるものを追跡するために使用されます。 メトリクスは、システムのパフォーマンスを示すデータです。 小規模なクラスターでも大規模なクラスターでも、システムの健全性とパフォーマンスに関する洞察を得ることで、改善が必要な領域の特定、問題のトラブルシューティングとトレース、そしてワークロード全体のパフォーマンスと効率性の向上が可能になります。 これらの変更は、クラスターに費やす時間とリソースに影響を与え、それは直接コストに反映されます。 メトリクス収集 EKS クラスターからのメトリクス収集は、3 つのコンポーネントで構成されています： ソース：このガイドに記載されているようなメトリクスの発生源。 エージェント：EKS 環境で実行されるアプリケーションで、一般的にエージェントと呼ばれ、メトリクスの監視データを収集し、2 番目のコンポーネントにプッシュします。このコンポーネントの例として、AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) や CloudWatch Agent があります。 送信先：監視データの保存と分析ソリューションで、このコンポーネントは通常、時系列形式のデータに最適化されたデータサービスです。このコンポーネントの例として、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus や AWS CloudWatch があります。 注：このセクションでは、設定例は AWS Observability Accelerator

Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus や AWS Cloudwatch などの様々なモニタリングデータ収集ソリューションに送信できます。 ADOT は EKS Managed Add-ons を通じて EKS クラスターにインストールでき、メトリクス (このページに記載されているものなど) やワークロードのトレースを収集するように設定できます。 AWS は、ADOT アドオンが Amazon EKS と互換性があることを検証しており、最新のバグ修正とセキュリティパッチで定期的に更新されています。 ADOT のベストプラクティスと詳細情報はこちら。 ADOT + AMP​ AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT)、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP)、Amazon

このガイドでは、利用可能なメトリクスの異なるグループを概説し、インフラストラクチャとアプリケーションにオブザーバビリティを組み込む際に注目すべきメトリクスを説明します。 以下のメトリクスのリストは、ベストプラクティスに基づいて監視することをお勧めするメトリクスです。 以下のセクションに記載されているメトリクスは、AWS Observability Accelerator Grafana ダッシュボード と Kube Prometheus Stack ダッシュボード で強調されているメトリクスに追加されるものです。 コントロールプレーンのメトリクス​ Amazon EKS コントロールプレーンは AWS によって管理され、AWS が管理するアカウントで実行されます。 etcd や Kubernetes API サーバーなどの Kubernetes コンポーネントを実行するコントロールプレーンノードで構成されています。 Kubernetes は、Pod、デプロイメント、名前空間などの起動や終了といったクラスター内のアクティビティをユーザーに通知するために、さまざまなイベントを発行します。 Amazon EKS コントロールプレーンは重要なコンポーネントであり、コアコンポーネントが適切に機能し、クラスターに必要な基本的なアクティビティを実行できることを確認するために追跡する必要があります。 コントロールプレーン API サーバーは数千のメトリクスを公開しています。以下の表は、監視することをお勧めする重要なコントロールプレーンメトリクスを示しています。 名前 メトリクス 説明 理由 API

(KSM) によって生成されます。 KSM はクラスター内で Pod として実行され、Kubernetes API サーバーをリッスンし、クラスターの状態と Kubernetes オブジェクトの情報を Prometheus メトリクスとして提供するユーティリティです。 これらのメトリクスを利用するには、KSM をインストールする必要があります。 これらのメトリクスは、Kubernetes が効果的に Pod のスケジューリングを行うために使用され、デプロイメント、レプリカセット、ノード、Pod などの様々なオブジェクトの健全性に焦点を当てています。 クラスターの状態メトリクスは、Pod のステータス、キャパシティ、可用性に関する情報を公開します。 クラスターのパフォーマンスを追跡し、問題を事前に把握し、クラスターの健全性を監視できるように、クラスターのスケジューリングタスクのパフォーマンスを把握することが重要です。 クラスターの状態メトリクスは約 X 個公開されており、以下の表は追跡すべき重要なメトリクスを示しています。 名前 メトリクス 説明 ノードステータス kube_node_status_condition

これには、オブザーバビリティエージェントや、クラスターがネットワーク、コンピューティング、ストレージの AWS リソースと連携するための Kubernetes ドライバーなどのソフトウェアが含まれます。 アドオンソフトウェアは通常、Kubernetes コミュニティ、AWS などのクラウドプロバイダー、またはサードパーティベンダーによって構築・維持されています。 Amazon EKS は、Amazon VPC CNI プラグイン for Kubernetes、kube-proxy、CoreDNS などのセルフマネージド型アドオンを各クラスターに自動的にインストールします。 これらのクラスターアドオンは、ネットワーキングやドメイン名解決など、さまざまな分野で運用サポートを提供します。 重要なインフラストラクチャやコンポーネントがどのように動作しているかについての洞察を提供します。 クラスターの運用状態を理解するためには、アドオンのメトリクスを追跡することが重要です。 以下は、監視を検討すべき重要なアドオンとそれらの重要なメトリクスです。 Amazon VPC CNI Plugin​ Amazon EKS は、Amazon VPC Container Network Interface (VPC CNI) プラグインを通じてクラスターのネットワーキングを実装します。 CNI プラグインにより、Kubernetes Pod は VPC ネットワーク上と同じ IP アドレスを持つことができます。 具体的には、Pod 内のすべてのコンテナはネットワーク名前空間を共有し、ローカルポートを使用して相互に通信できます。 VPC CNI アドオンを使用することで、Amazon EKS クラスターのセキュリティと安定性を継続的に確保し、アドオンのインストール、設定、更新に必要な作業を削減できます。 VPC CNI アドオンのメトリクスは、CNI Metrics Helper によって公開されます。 IP アドレスの割り当てを監視することは、クラスターの健全性を確保し、IP アドレスの枯渇問題を回避するために重要です。 最新のネットワーキングのベストプラクティスと収集・監視すべき VPC CNI メトリクスはこちらをご覧ください。 CoreDNS メトリクス​ CoreDNS は柔軟で拡張可能な DNS サーバーで、Kubernetes クラスターの DNS として機能します。CoreDNS Pod は、クラスター内のすべての Pod の名前解決を提供します。DNS を集中的に使用するワークロードを実行すると、DNS スロットリングにより断続的な CoreDNS の障害が発生することがあり、これがアプリケーションに影響を与える可能性があります。 CoreDNS パフォーマンスメトリクスの最新のベストプラクティスはこちらと DNS スロットリングの問題に関する CoreDNS トラフィックのモニタリングをご確認ください。 Pod/Container メトリクス​ アプリケーションのすべてのレイヤーにわたる使用状況を追跡することは重要です。これには、クラスター内で実行されているノードと Pod を詳しく確認することが含まれます。Pod のディメンションで利用可能なすべてのメトリクスの中で、このメトリクスのリストは、クラスター上で実行されているワークロードの状態を理解するために実用的です。CPU、メモリ、ネットワークの使用状況を追跡することで、アプリケーション関連の問題の診断とトラブルシューティングが可能になります。ワークロードのメトリクスを追跡することで、EKS で実行されているワークロードの適切なサイジングのためのリソース使用状況の洞察が得られます。 メトリクス PromQL クエリの例 ディメンション 名前空間ごとの実行中の Pod 数 count by(namespace) (kube_pod_info) クラスターごとの名前空間 Pod ごとのコンテナごとの CPU 使用量

KEDA を使用したアプリケーションのオートスケーリング このページの見出し AMP と EKS で KEDA を使用したアプリケーションのオートスケーリング 現状の課題 Amazon EKS アプリケーションでのトラフィック増加への対応は課題となっています。手動でのスケーリングは非効率で、エラーが発生しやすい状況です。 オートスケーリングは、リソース割り当ての優れたソリューションを提供します。KEDA は、様々なメトリクスとイベントに基づいて Kubernetes のオートスケーリングを可能にし、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus は EKS クラスターの安全なメトリクスモニタリングを提供します。 このソリューションでは、KEDA と Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus を組み合わせ、1 秒あたりのリクエスト数 (RPS) メトリクスに基づくオートスケーリングを実演します。このアプローチにより、ワークロードの需要に合わせた自動スケーリングが実現され、ユーザーは自身の EKS ワークロードに適用できます。 Amazon Managed Grafana を使用してスケーリングパターンのモニタリングと可視化を行うことで、ユーザーはオートスケーリングの動作を把握し、ビジネスイベントと関連付けることができます。 KEDA による AMP メトリクスを使用したアプリケーションのオートスケーリング このソリューションは、自動スケーリングパイプラインを作成するための AWS とオープンソースソフトウェアの統合を示しています。 マネージド Kubernetes サービスの Amazon EKS、メトリクス収集のための AWS Distro for Open Telemetry (ADOT)、イベント駆動型オートスケーリングの KEDA、メトリクスストレージの Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus、可視化のための Amazon Managed Grafana を組み合わせています。 アーキテクチャには、EKS への KEDA のデプロイ、メトリクスをスクレイピングするための ADOT の設定、KEDA ScaledObject によるオートスケーリングルールの定義、スケーリングを監視するための Grafana ダッシュボードの使用が含まれています。 オートスケーリングプロセスは、マイクロサービスへのユーザーリクエストから始まり、ADOT がメトリクスを収集し、Prometheus に送信します。 KEDA は定期的にこれらのメトリクスをクエリし、スケーリングの必要性を判断し、Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) と連携して Pod のレプリカ数を調整します。 このセットアップにより、Kubernetes マイクロサービスのメトリクス駆動型オートスケーリングが可能になり、さまざまな使用率指標に基づいてスケーリングできる柔軟なクラウドネイティブアーキテクチャを提供します。 AMP メトリクスを使用した KEDA による EKS アプリケーションのクロスアカウントスケーリング この例では、KEDA EKS が ID 117 で終わる AWS アカウントで実行され、中央の AMP アカウント ID が 814 で終わると仮定します。KEDA EKS アカウントで、以下のようにクロスアカウント IAM ロールを設定します。 また、信頼関係を以下のように更新する必要があります： EKS クラスターでは、IRSA が使用されているため Pod アイデンティティを使用していないことがわかります。 中央の AMP アカウントでは、以下のように AMP アクセスを設定しています。 信頼関係にもアクセス権が設定されています。 以下のようにワークスペース ID をメモしておきます。 KEDA の設定​ セットアップが完了したら、以下のように KEDA が実行されていることを確認します。セットアップ手順については、以下のブログリンクを参照してください。 設定で上記で定義した中央の AMP ロールを使用していることを確認してください。 KEDA スケーラーの設定で、以下のように中央の AMP アカウントを指定します。 これで Pod が適切にスケールされていることが確認できます。 ブログ​

の採用は、多くの企業がマイクロサービスベースのアーキテクチャに移行するにつれて、加速し続けています。 当初は、アプリケーションをサポートするための新しいクラウドネイティブアーキテクチャの設計と構築に重点が置かれていました。 環境が成長するにつれて、お客様からリソース割り当ての最適化に焦点が移ってきているのが分かります。 リソースの最適化は、セキュリティに次いで運用チームが重要視する 2 番目の課題です。 Kubernetes 環境でのリソース割り当ての最適化とアプリケーションの適切なサイジングについてのガイダンスを説明しましょう。 これには、マネージド型ノードグループ、セルフマネージド型ノードグループ、AWS Fargate でデプロイされた Amazon EKS 上で実行されるアプリケーションが含まれます。 Kubernetes でアプリケーションをライトサイジングする理由​ Kubernetes では、アプリケーションにリソース仕様を設定することでライトサイジングを行います。これらの設定は以下に直接影響を与えます： パフォーマンス — 適切なリソース仕様がない場合、Kubernetes アプリケーションは無秩序にリソースを奪い合います。これはアプリケーションのパフォーマンスに悪影響を及ぼす可能性があります。 コスト最適化 — リソース仕様を過剰に設定してデプロイされたアプリケーションは、コストの増加とインフラストラクチャの低使用率を招きます。 オートスケーリング — Kubernetes クラスターオートスケーラーと水平 Pod オートスケーリングは、機能するためにリソース仕様を必要とします。 Kubernetes で最も一般的なリソース仕様は、CPU とメモリのリクエストとリミットです。 リクエストとリミット​ コンテナ化されたアプリケーションは、Kubernetes 上で Pod としてデプロイされます。CPU とメモリのリクエストとリミットは、Pod 定義のオプション部分です。CPU は Kubernetes CPUs の単位で指定され、メモリは通常 メビバイト (Mi) として指定されるバイト単位で指定されます。 リクエストとリミットは、Kubernetes で異なる機能を果たし、スケジューリングとリソース制御に異なる影響を与えます。 推奨事項​ アプリケーションの所有者は、CPU とメモリのリソース要求に対して「適切な」値を選択する必要があります。 理想的な方法は、開発環境でアプリケーションの負荷テストを実施し、オブザーバビリティツールを使用してリソース使用量を測定することです。 これは組織の最重要アプリケーションには適していますが、クラスターにデプロイされているすべてのコンテナ化アプリケーションに対して実施することは現実的ではないかもしれません。 ワークロードを最適化し、適切なサイズを設定するのに役立つツールについて説明しましょう： Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)​ VPA は、Autoscaling Special Interest Group (SIG) が所有する Kubernetes のサブプロジェクトです。 観測されたアプリケーションのパフォーマンスに基づいて、Pod のリクエストを自動的に設定するように設計されています。 VPA は、デフォルトで Kubernetes Metric Server を使用してリソース使用量を収集しますが、オプションで Prometheus をデータソースとして使用するように設定することもできます。 VPA には、アプリケーションのパフォーマンスを測定し、サイジングの推奨を行うレコメンデーションエンジンがあります。 VPA レコメンデーションエンジンはスタンドアロンでデプロイでき、VPA は自動スケーリングアクションを実行しません。 各アプリケーションの VerticalPodAutoscaler カスタムリソースを作成することで設定され、VPA はオブジェクトのステータスフィールドをリソースサイジングの推奨値で更新します。 クラスター内のすべてのアプリケーションに対して VerticalPodAutoscaler オブジェクトを作成し、JSON 結果を読み取って解釈することは、スケールが大きくなると困難です。 Goldilocks は、これを簡単にするオープンソースプロジェクトです。 Goldilocks​ Goldilocks は Fairwinds のオープンソースプロジェクトで、組織が Kubernetes アプリケーションのリソースリクエストを「ちょうど良い」状態にするのを支援するように設計されています。Goldilocks のデフォルト設定はオプトインモデルです。名前空間に goldilocks.fairwinds.com/enabled: true ラベルを追加することで、監視するワークロードを選択できます。 Metrics Server はワーカーノードで実行されている Kubelet からリソースメトリクスを収集し、Vertical Pod Autoscaler が使用するために Metrics API を通じて公開します。Goldilocks コントローラーは goldilocks.fairwinds.com/enabled: true ラベルが付いた名前空間を監視し、それらの名前空間内の各ワークロードに対して VerticalPodAutoscaler オブジェクトを作成します。 リソース推奨を有効にするために、以下のコマンドを実行します： kubectl create ns javajmx-sample kubectl label ns javajmx-sample goldilocks.fairwinds.com/enabled=true Amazon EKS クラスターに Goldilocks をデプロイするには、以下のコマンドを実行します： helm repo add fairwinds-stable https://charts.fairwinds.com/stable helm upgrade --install goldilocks fairwinds-stable/goldilocks --namespace goldilocks --create-namespace --set vpa.enabled=true Goldilocks ダッシュボードはポート 8080 でダッシュボードを公開し、リソース推奨を確認することができます。ダッシュボードにアクセスするために、以下のコマンドを実行しましょう： kubectl -n goldilocks port-forward svc/goldilocks-dashboard 8080:80 その後、ブラウザで http://localhost:8080 を開きます。 Goldilocks が提供する推奨事項を確認するために、サンプル名前空間を分析してみましょう。デプロイメントの推奨事項を確認することができます。 javajmx-sample ワークロードのリクエストとリミットの推奨事項を確認できます。各 Quality of Service (QoS) の Current 列は、現在設定されている CPU とメモリのリクエストとリミットを示しています。Guaranteed と Burstable 列は、それぞれの QoS に対する推奨 CPU とメモリのリクエストリミットを示しています。 リソースを過剰にプロビジョニングしていることが明確に分かり、Goldilocks は CPU とメモリのリクエストを最適化するための推奨事項を提供しています。Guaranteed QoS の場合、CPU のリクエストとリミットは 100m と 300m に対して 15m と 15m が推奨され、メモリのリクエストとリミットは 180Mi と 300Mi に対して 105M と 105M が推奨されています。 必要な QoS クラスに対応するマニフェストファイルを単純にコピーし、適切なサイズに最適化されたワークロードをデプロイすることができます。 cAdvisor メトリクスを使用したスロットリングの理解と適切なリソースの設定​ 制限を設定する際、特定のコンテナ化されたアプリケーションが特定の期間中にどれだけ実行できるかを Linux ノードに指示します。 これは、制御不能なプロセスが不当な量の CPU サイクルを消費することから、ノード上の他のワークロードを保護するために行います。 マザーボード上の物理的な「コア」の数を定義しているわけではありませんが、他のアプリケーションに影響を与えないように、単一のコンテナ内のプロセスやスレッドのグループを一時的に停止するまでの実行時間を設定しています。 container_cpu_cfs_throttled_seconds_total という便利な cAdvisor メトリクスがあり、これはスロットリングされた 5 ミリ秒のスライスをすべて合計し、プロセスがクォータをどれだけ超過しているかを示します。 このメトリクスは秒単位なので、値を 10 で割ることで、コンテナに関連付けられた実際の期間である 100 ミリ秒を得ることができます。 100 ミリ秒の時間における上位 3 つの Pod の CPU 使用率を理解するための PromQL クエリ： topk(3, max by (pod, container)(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{image!=\"\", instance=\"$instance\"}[$__rate_interval]))) / 10 vCPU 使用率の値として 400 ミリ秒が観測されています。 PromQL は 1 秒あたりのスロットリングを提供し、1 秒間に 10 の期間があります。 期間あたりのスロットリングを得るには、10 で割ります。 制限設定をどれだけ増やすべきかを知りたい場合は、10 を掛けます（例：400 ミリ秒 * 10 = 4000 m）。 上記のツールはリソース最適化の機会を特定する方法を提供しますが、アプリケーションチームは、特定のアプリケーションが CPU / メモリ集約型かどうかを識別し、スロットリングやオーバープロビジョニングを防ぐためのリソース割り当てに時間を費やす必要があります。 このページを編集 Kubernetes でアプリケーションをライトサイジングする理由 リクエストとリミット 推奨事項 Vertical Pod

正確なリソースサイジングのための Amazon CloudWatch メモリメトリクス​ AWS OLA for EEC2 は Amazon EC2 のリソースサイジングのための評価レポートを提供しますが、Amazon CloudWatch が提供するインサイトは、より正確なリソースサイジングのためにメモリ使用率メトリクスを組み込む価値を理解しています。 そのため、AWS OLA for EEC2 プログラムと共に Amazon CloudWatch メモリメトリクスのモニタリングを推奨・促進することで、お客様は AWS 環境により効果的なリソース最適化の推奨事項を得ることができ、ワークロードのリソース消費についてより広い視点を得ることができます。 これにより、ワークロードのコスト削減とパフォーマンスの向上を実現できます。 Amazon EC2 インスタンスは、デフォルトで複数のメトリクスを Amazon CloudWatch に送信します。 しかし、メモリメトリクスは Amazon EC2 が提供するデフォルトのメトリクスには含まれていません。 Amazon EC2 のメモリメトリクスを把握することで、EC2 インスタンスの現在のメモリ使用率を理解し、インスタンスのプロビジョニング不足や過剰プロビジョニングを防ぐことができます。 Amazon EC2 インスタンスのプロビジョニング不足は、システムやアプリケーションのパフォーマンスを低下させる一方、過剰プロビジョニングは無駄な支出を生みます。 ビッグデータ分析、インメモリデータベース、リアルタイムストリーミングなどのメモリを大量に使用するアプリケーションでは、運用の可視性を確保するためにインスタンスのメモリ使用率を監視する必要があります。 Amazon EC2 インスタンスからのメモリメトリクスの収集​ Amazon EC2 インスタンス からメモリメトリクスを収集するための手順の概要は以下の通りです。 AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) でロールを作成し、以下の権限を付与します： Amazon Systems Manager で Amazon EC2 インスタンスを管理するための権限。これは Amazon EC2 インスタンスが Systems Manager で管理されている場合に必要です。AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) は、インスタンスが AWS Systems Manager と通信し、Systems Manager Run Command を EC2 インスタンスで実行するなど、リモートコマンドやスクリプトの実行を可能にするために必要です。AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) は、Amazon EC2 インスタンスにインストールされて実行される Amazon のソフトウェアで、Amazon Systems Manager サービスが EC2 インスタンスを管理対象インスタンスとして更新、管理、設定することを可能にします。SSM エージェントは Systems Manager サービスからリクエストを受け取り、それを処理し、ステータスと実行情報を Systems Manager サービスに送り返します。なお、AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) は、AWS が提供する一部の Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) にデフォルトでプリインストールされています。 CloudWatch エージェントウィザードを使用して CloudWatch エージェント設定ファイルを生成する場合、オプションとして Systems Manager Parameter Store を設定ファイルを保存する安全な共通の場所として使用できます。その場合、CloudWatch エージェントは設定ファイルを書き込むための書き込みアクセス権と、設定ファイルを読み取るための読み取りアクセス権を Systems Manager Parameter

環境におけるコストとリソース効率の可視化を提供します。 概要として、Amazon EKS のコストモニタリングは、オープンソースのモニタリングシステムおよび時系列データベースである Prometheus を含む Kubecost によってデプロイされます。 Kubecost は Prometheus からメトリクスを読み取り、コスト配分の計算を実行し、その結果を Prometheus に書き戻します。 最後に、Kubecost フロントエンドが Prometheus からメトリクスを読み取り、Kubecost ユーザーインターフェース (UI) に表示します。 アーキテクチャは以下の図のとおりです： Kubecost を使用する理由​ お客様がアプリケーションをモダナイズし、Amazon EKS を使用してワークロードをデプロイする際、アプリケーションの実行に必要なコンピューティングリソースを統合することで効率性を獲得できます。 しかし、この利用効率の向上は、アプリケーションコストの測定が難しくなるというトレードオフを伴います。 現在、テナントごとのコスト配分には以下のいずれかの方法を使用できます： ハードマルチテナンシー — 専用の AWS アカウントで個別の EKS クラスターを実行します。 ソフトマルチテナンシー — 共有 EKS クラスター内で複数のノードグループを実行します。 消費ベースの課金 — 共有 EKS クラスター内のリソース消費量に基づいてコストを計算します。 ハードマルチテナンシーでは、ワークロードは個別の EKS クラスターにデプロイされ、各テナントの支出を判断するためのレポートを実行することなく、クラスターとその依存関係のコストを特定できます。 ソフトマルチテナンシーでは、Node Selectors や Node Affinity などの Kubernetes の機能を使用して、Kubernetes Scheduler にテナントのワークロードを専用のノードグループで実行するよう指示できます。 ノードグループ内の EC2 インスタンスに識別子（製品名やチーム名など）でタグを付け、タグ を使用してコストを配分できます。 上記 2 つのアプローチの欠点は、未使用のキャパシティが発生する可能性があり、密にパックされたクラスターを実行した場合のコスト削減効果を十分に活用できない可能性があることです。 また、Elastic Load Balancing やネットワーク転送料金などの共有リソースのコストを配分する方法も必要です。 マルチテナント Kubernetes クラスターでコストを追跡する最も効率的な方法は、ワークロードが消費したリソースの量に基づいて発生したコストを配分することです。 このパターンでは、異なるワークロードがノードを共有できるため、ノード上の Pod 密度を高めることができ、EC2 インスタンスの使用率を最大化できます。 しかし、ワークロードや名前空間ごとのコストを計算することは困難な作業です。 ワークロードのコスト責任を理解するには、一定期間に消費または予約されたすべてのリソースを集計し、リソースのコストと使用期間に基づいて料金を評価する必要があります。 これが Kubecost が取り組んでいる課題です。 ヒント Kubecost のハンズオン体験をするには、One Observability Workshop をご覧ください。 推奨事項​ コスト配分​ Kubecost のコスト配分ダッシュボードでは、名前空間、k8s ラベル、サービスなど、すべてのネイティブな Kubernetes の概念に対する配分された支出と最適化の機会を素早く確認できます。 また、チーム、製品/プロジェクト、部門、環境などの組織の概念にコストを配分することもできます。 日付範囲やフィルターを変更して、特定のワークロードに関するインサイトを導き出し、レポートを保存することができます。 Kubernetes のコストを最適化するには、効率性とクラスターのアイドルコストに注意を払う必要があります。 効率性​ Pod のリソース効率は、一定の時間枠におけるリソースの使用量とリソースのリクエスト量の比率として定義されます。 これはコストで重み付けされ、以下のように表現できます： (((CPU Usage / CPU Requested) * CPU Cost) + ((RAM Usage / RAM Requested) * RAM Cost)) / (RAM Cost + CPU Cost) ここで、CPU Usage = 時間枠における rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total)、RAM Usage = 時間枠における avg(container_memory_working_set_bytes) です。 AWS では明示的な RAM、CPU、GPU の価格は提供されていないため、Kubecost モデルは提供された CPU、GPU、RAM の基本価格の比率を使用します。 これらのパラメータのデフォルト値はクラウドプロバイダーの限界リソースレートに基づいていますが、Kubecost 内でカスタマイズすることができます。 これらの基本リソース（RAM/CPU/GPU）の価格は、プロバイダーの課金レートに基づいて、各コンポーネントの合計がプロビジョニングされたノードの総価格と等しくなるように正規化されます。 最大効率を目指し、ワークロードを微調整してゴールを達成することは、各サービスチームの責任です。 アイドルコスト​ クラスターのアイドルコストは、割り当てられたリソースのコストと、それらが実行されているハードウェアのコストの差として定義されます。 割り当ては、使用量とリクエストの最大値として定義されます。 これは以下のように表現することもできます： idle_cost = sum(node_cost) - (cpu_allocation_cost + ram_allocation_cost + gpu_allocation_cost) ここで、allocation = max(request, usage) となります。 つまり、アイドルコストは、既存のワークロードを中断することなく Kubernetes スケジューラが Pod をスケジュールできるスペースのコストと考えることができますが、現在は使用されていません。 設定方法に応じて、ワークロードやクラスター、ノードごとに分配することができます。 ネットワークコスト​ Kubecost は、ワークロードが生成するネットワーク転送コストを、ベストエフォートで割り当てます。ネットワークコストを正確に判断するには、AWS Cloud Integration と Network costs daemonset を組み合わせて使用します。 クラスターの潜在能力を最大限に活用するためには、効率性スコアとアイドルコストを考慮してワークロードを微調整する必要があります。これは、次のトピックであるクラスターのライトサイジングにつながります。 ワークロードのライトサイジング​ Kubecost は、Kubernetes ネイティブのメトリクスに基づいてワークロードのライトサイジングに関する推奨事項を提供します。 Kubecost UI のセービングパネルは、その確認を始めるのに最適な場所です。 Kubecost は以下の推奨事項を提供できます： オーバープロビジョニングとアンダープロビジョニングの両方を考慮したコンテナリクエストのライトサイジング 未使用のキャパシティに対する過剰な支出を抑制するためのクラスターノードの数とサイズの調整 有意な量のトラフィックの送受信がないポッドのスケールダウン、削除、リサイズ スポットノードに適したワークロードの特定 ポッドによって使用されていないボリュームの特定 また、Kubecost には、Cluster Controller コンポーネントが有効な場合、コンテナリソースリクエストに関する推奨事項を自動的に実装できるプレリリース機能があります。 自動リクエストライトサイジングを使用することで、複雑な YAML やややこしい kubectl コマンドをテストすることなく、クラスター全体のリソース割り当てを即座に最適化できます。 クラスター内のリソースの過剰な割り当てを簡単に排除でき、クラスターのライトサイジングやその他の最適化による大幅なコスト削減への道が開かれます。 Kubecost と Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus の統合​ Kubecost は、時系列データベースとしてオープンソースの Prometheus プロジェクトを活用し、Prometheus のデータを後処理してコスト配分の計算を実行します。クラスターのサイズとワークロードの規模によっては、Prometheus サーバーがメトリクスをスクレイピングして保存するのが負担になる場合があります。このような場合、マネージド型の Prometheus 互換モニタリングサービスである Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus を使用して、メトリクスを確実に保存し、Kubernetes のコストを大規模に簡単にモニタリングすることができます。 Kubecost サービスアカウント用の IAM ロール をセットアップする必要があります。クラスターの OIDC プロバイダーを使用して、クラスターのサービスアカウントに IAM 権限を付与します。kubecost-cost-analyzer と kubecost-prometheus-server のサービスアカウントに適切な権限を付与する必要があります。これらは、ワークスペースとの間でメトリクスの送受信に使用されます。コマンドラインで以下のコマンドを実行してください： eksctl create iamserviceaccount \\ --name kubecost-cost-analyzer \\ --namespace kubecost \\ --cluster <CLUSTER_NAME> \\ --region <REGION> \\ --attach-policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonPrometheusQueryAccess \\ --attach-policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonPrometheusRemoteWriteAccess \\ --override-existing-serviceaccounts \\ --approve eksctl create iamserviceaccount \\ --name kubecost-prometheus-server \\ --namespace

arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonPrometheusRemoteWriteAccess \\ --override-existing-serviceaccounts \\ --approve CLUSTER_NAME は Kubecost をインストールしたい Amazon EKS クラスターの名前で、「REGION」は Amazon EKS クラスターのリージョンです。 完了したら、以下のように Kubecost helm チャートをアップグレードする必要があります： helm upgrade -i kubecost \\ oci://public.ecr.aws/kubecost/cost-analyzer --version <$VERSION> \\ --namespace kubecost --create-namespace \\ -f https://tinyurl.com/kubecost-amazon-eks \\ -f https://tinyurl.com/kubecost-amp \\ --set global.amp.prometheusServerEndpoint=${QUERYURL} \\ --set global.amp.remoteWriteService=${REMOTEWRITEURL} Kubecost UI へのアクセス​ Kubecost は、kubectl port-forward、Ingress、またはロードバランサーを通じてアクセスできる Web ダッシュボードを提供しています。 Kubecost のエンタープライズバージョンでは、SSO/SAML を使用してダッシュボードへのアクセスを制限し、様々なレベルのアクセス権を提供することもできます。 例えば、チームの表示を担当する製品のみに制限することができます。 AWS 環境では、AWS Load Balancer Controller を使用して Kubecost を公開し、認証、認可、ユーザー管理に Amazon Cognito を使用することを検討してください。 詳細については、How to use Application Load Balancer and Amazon Cognito to authenticate users for your Kubernetes web apps をご覧ください。 マルチクラスタービュー​ FinOps チームは、ビジネスオーナーに推奨事項を共有するために EKS クラスターをレビューする必要があります。 大規模な運用では、推奨事項を確認するために各クラスターにログインすることが、チームにとって課題となります。 マルチクラスターを使用すると、グローバルに集約されたクラスターのコストを単一の画面で確認できます。 複数のクラスターを持つ環境向けに、Kubecost は Kubecost Free、Kubecost Business、Kubecost Enterprise の 3 つのオプションをサポートしています。 Free と Business モードでは、クラウドの課金調整は各クラスターレベルで実行されます。 Enterprise モードでは、クラウドの課金調整は、Kubecost UI を提供し、メトリクスが保存される共有バケットを使用するプライマリクラスターで実行されます。 Enterprise モードを使用する場合のみ、メトリクスの保持期間が無制限になることに注意してください。 参考資料​ One Observability

モニタリングは、Amazon RDS と Aurora データベースクラスターの信頼性、可用性、パフォーマンスを維持するための重要な要素です。 AWS は、Amazon RDS と Aurora データベースリソースの健全性を監視し、問題が重大化する前に検出し、一貫したユーザーエクスペリエンスのためにパフォーマンスを最適化するための複数のツールを提供しています。 このガイドでは、データベースが円滑に稼働することを確実にするためのオブザーバビリティのベストプラクティスを提供します。 パフォーマンスのガイドライン​ ベストプラクティスとして、まずワークロードのベースラインパフォーマンスを確立することから始めます。 DB インスタンスをセットアップし、一般的なワークロードで実行する際、すべてのパフォーマンスメトリクスの平均値、最大値、最小値を収集します。 これを様々な間隔（例：1 時間、24 時間、1 週間、2 週間）で行います。 これにより、何が通常の状態なのかを把握することができます。 ピーク時と非ピーク時の運用時間の比較を得るのに役立ちます。 この情報を使用して、パフォーマンスが標準レベルを下回っているタイミングを特定できます。 モニタリングのオプション​ Amazon CloudWatch メトリクス​ Amazon CloudWatch は、RDS と Aurora データベースを監視および管理するための重要なツールです。 データベースのパフォーマンスに関する貴重な洞察を提供し、問題を素早く特定して解決するのに役立ちます。 Amazon RDS と Aurora データベースは、アクティブなデータベースインスタンスごとに 1 分間隔でメトリクスを CloudWatch に送信します。 監視はデフォルトで有効になっており、メトリクスは 15 日間利用可能です。 RDS と Aurora は、インスタンスレベルのメトリクスを AWS/RDS 名前空間の Amazon CloudWatch に公開します。 CloudWatch メトリクスを使用することで、データベースのパフォーマンスの傾向やパターンを特定し、この情報を使用して設定を最適化し、アプリケーションのパフォーマンスを改善できます。 監視すべき主要なメトリクスは以下の通りです： CPU 使用率 - 使用されているコンピュータ処理能力の割合。 DB 接続数 - DB インスタンスに接続されているクライアントセッションの数。インスタンスのパフォーマンスとレスポンスタイムの低下と共にユーザー接続数が多いことが確認された場合は、データベース接続数を制限することを検討してください。DB インスタンスに最適なユーザー接続数は、インスタンスクラスと実行される操作の複雑さによって異なります。データベース接続数を決定するには、DB インスタンスをパラメータグループに関連付けます。 解放可能なメモリ - DB インスタンスで利用可能な RAM の量（メガバイト単位）。モニタリングタブのメトリクスでは、CPU、メモリ、ストレージメトリクスの赤線が 75% でマークされています。インスタンスのメモリ消費がこのラインを頻繁に超える場合は、ワークロードを確認するかインスタンスをアップグレードする必要があることを示しています。 ネットワークスループット - DB インスタンスとの間のネットワークトラフィックの速度（バイト/秒）。 読み取り/書き込みレイテンシー - 読み取りまたは書き込み操作の平均時間（ミリ秒単位）。 読み取り/書き込み IOPS - 1 秒あたりの平均ディスク読み取りまたは書き込み操作数。 空きストレージスペース - DB インスタンスで現在使用されていないディスク容量（メガバイト単位）。使用済みスペースが総ディスク容量の 85% 以上で一貫している場合は、ディスク容量の消費を調査してください。インスタンスからデータを削除するか、別のシステムにデータをアーカイブしてスペースを解放できるかどうかを確認してください。 パフォーマンス関連の問題のトラブルシューティングでは、最初のステップとして、最も使用頻度が高く、コストのかかるクエリをチューニングします。 システムリソースへの負荷を軽減できるかどうかを確認するために、これらのクエリをチューニングしてください。 詳細については、クエリのチューニングを参照してください。 クエリがチューニングされても問題が解決しない場合は、データベースインスタンスクラスのアップグレードを検討してください。 より多くのリソース（CPU、RAM、ディスク容量、ネットワーク帯域幅、I/O 容量）を持つインスタンスにアップグレードできます。 その後、これらのメトリクスが重要なしきい値に達したときにアラートを設定し、問題を可能な限り迅速に解決するための対策を講じることができます。 CloudWatch メトリクスの詳細については、Amazon RDS の Amazon CloudWatch メトリクスとCloudWatch コンソールと AWS CLI での DB インスタンスメトリクスの表示を参照してください。 CloudWatch Logs Insights​ CloudWatch Logs Insights を使用すると、Amazon CloudWatch Logs のログデータをインタラクティブに検索および分析できます。 クエリを実行することで、運用上の問題により効率的かつ効果的に対応できます。 問題が発生した場合、CloudWatch Logs Insights を使用して潜在的な原因を特定し、デプロイされた修正を検証できます。 RDS または Aurora データベースクラスターからのログを CloudWatch に公開する方法については、RDS または Aurora for MySQL インスタンスのログを CloudWatch に公開する を参照してください。 CloudWatch を使用した RDS または Aurora ログのモニタリングの詳細については、Amazon RDS ログファイルのモニタリング を参照してください。 CloudWatch アラーム​ データベースクラスターのパフォーマンス低下を特定するために、主要なパフォーマンスメトリクスを定期的に監視し、アラートを設定する必要があります。 Amazon CloudWatch アラーム を使用すると、指定した期間にわたって単一のメトリクスを監視できます。 メトリクスが指定したしきい値を超えると、Amazon SNS トピックまたは AWS Auto Scaling ポリシーに通知が送信されます。 CloudWatch アラームは、特定の状態にあるだけでは、アクションを実行しません。 状態が変更され、指定された期間数にわたって維持されている必要があります。 アラームは、アラームの状態が変更された場合にのみアクションを実行します。 アラーム状態にあるだけでは不十分です。 CloudWatch アラームを設定するには： AWS マネジメントコンソールに移動し、https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/ で Amazon RDS コンソールを開きます。 ナビゲーションペインで「データベース」を選択し、DB インスタンスを選択します。 「ログとイベント」を選択します。 CloudWatch アラームセクションで、「アラームの作成」を選択します。 「通知の送信」で「はい」を選択し、「通知の送信先」で「新しいメールまたは SMS トピック」を選択します。 「トピック名」に通知の名前を入力し、「受信者」にメールアドレスと電話番号をカンマ区切りで入力します。 「メトリクス」で、設定するアラームの統計とメトリクスを選択します。 「しきい値」で、メトリクスがしきい値より大きいか、小さいか、等しいかを指定し、しきい値を設定します。 「評価期間」でアラームの評価期間を選択します。「連続する期間」で、アラームをトリガーするためにしきい値に達している必要がある期間を選択します。 「アラーム名」にアラームの名前を入力します。 「アラームの作成」を選択します。 アラームが CloudWatch アラームセクションに表示されます。 マルチ AZ DB クラスターのレプリカラグに対する Amazon CloudWatch アラームを作成する例をご覧ください。 データベース監査ログ​ データベース監査ログは、RDS と Aurora データベースで実行されたすべてのアクションの詳細な記録を提供し、不正アクセス、データ変更、その他の潜在的に有害なアクティビティを監視することができます。 以下は、データベース監査ログを使用する際のベストプラクティスです： すべての RDS と Aurora インスタンスでデータベース監査ログを有効にし、関連するすべてのデータを取得するように設定します。 Amazon CloudWatch Logs や Amazon Kinesis Data Streams などの一元化されたログ管理ソリューションを使用して、データベース監査ログを収集・分析します。 データベース監査ログを定期的に監視して不審なアクティビティを確認し、問題を迅速に調査・解決するための対策を講じます。 データベース監査ログの設定方法の詳細については、Amazon RDS と Aurora のデータベースアクティビティを取得するための監査ログの設定 を参照してください。 データベースのスロークエリとエラーログ​ スロークエリログは、データベース内の実行速度が遅いクエリを見つけるのに役立ちます。これにより、遅延の原因を調査し、必要に応じてクエリをチューニングすることができます。エラーログは、クエリのエラーを見つけるのに役立ち、それらのエラーによるアプリケーションの変更を特定するのに役立ちます。 Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights (CloudWatch Logs のログデータをインタラクティブに検索および分析できる機能) を使用して CloudWatch ダッシュボードを作成することで、スロークエリログとエラーログを監視できます。 Amazon RDS のエラーログ、スロークエリログ、一般ログを有効化して監視するには、RDS MySQL のスロークエリログと一般ログの管理 を参照してください。Aurora PostgreSQL のスロークエリログを有効にするには、PostgreSQL のスロークエリログの有効化 を参照してください。 Performance Insights とオペレーティングシステムのメトリクス​ 拡張モニタリング​ 拡張モニタリング を使用すると、DB インスタンスが実行されているオペレーティングシステム (OS) のきめ細かなメトリクスをリアルタイムで取得できます。 RDS は、拡張モニタリングのメトリクスを Amazon CloudWatch Logs アカウントに配信します。デフォルトでは、これらのメトリクスは 30 日間保存され、Amazon CloudWatch の RDSOSMetrics ロググループに格納されます。1 秒から 60 秒の間で粒度を選択できます。CloudWatch Logs からカスタムメトリクスフィルターを作成し、CloudWatch ダッシュボードにグラフを表示できます。 拡張モニタリングには、OS レベルのプロセスリストも含まれています。現在、拡張モニタリングは以下のデータベースエンジンで利用可能です： MariaDB Microsoft SQL Server MySQL Oracle PostgreSQL CloudWatch と拡張モニタリングの違い CloudWatch は、DB インスタンスのハイパーバイザーから CPU 使用率のメトリクスを収集します。一方、拡張モニタリングは DB インスタンス上のエージェントからメトリクスを収集します。ハイパーバイザーは仮想マシン (VM) を作成して実行します。ハイパーバイザーを使用することで、インスタンスはメモリと CPU を仮想的に共有して複数のゲスト VM をサポートできます。ハイパーバイザーレイヤーが少量の作業を実行するため、CloudWatch と拡張モニタリングの測定値に違いが生じる場合があります。DB インスタンスがより小さなインスタンスクラスを使用している場合、この違いはより大きくなる可能性があります。このシナリオでは、1 つの物理インスタンス上でハイパーバイザーレイヤーがより多くの仮想マシン (VM) を管理している可能性があります。 拡張モニタリングで利用可能なすべてのメトリクスについては、拡張モニタリングの OS メトリクス を参照してください。 Performance Insights​ Amazon RDS Performance Insights は、データベースのパフォーマンスチューニングとモニタリングの機能で、データベースの負荷を素早く評価し、いつどこで対策を講じるべきかを判断するのに役立ちます。 Performance Insights ダッシュボードでは、DB クラスターの負荷を可視化し、待機状態、SQL ステートメント、ホスト、またはユーザーで負荷をフィルタリングできます。 症状を追いかけるのではなく、根本原因を特定することができます。 Performance Insights は、アプリケーションのパフォーマンスに影響を与えない軽量なデータ収集方法を使用し、どの SQL ステートメントが負荷を引き起こしているのか、そしてその理由を簡単に確認することができます。 Performance Insights は 7 日間の無料パフォーマンス履歴保持を提供し、有料で最大 2 年まで延長できます。 RDS マネジメントコンソールまたは AWS CLI から Performance Insights を有効にできます。 Performance Insights は公開 API も提供しており、お客様やサードパーティが Performance Insights を独自のカスタムツールと統合できるようになっています。 注記 現在、RDS Performance Insights は、Aurora (PostgreSQL および MySQL 互換エディション)、Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL、MySQL、MariaDB、SQL Server、Oracle でのみ利用可能です。 DBLoad は、データベースのアクティブセッションの平均数を表す重要なメトリクスです。 Performance Insights では、このデータは db.load.avg メトリクスとして照会されます。 Aurora での Performance Insights の使用に関する詳細については、Amazon Aurora での Performance Insights を使用した DB 負荷のモニタリング を参照してください。 オープンソースのオブザーバビリティツール​ Amazon Managed Grafana​ Amazon Managed Grafana は、RDS および Aurora データベースのデータを簡単に可視化および分析できるフルマネージドサービスです。 Amazon CloudWatch の AWS/RDS 名前空間 には、Amazon RDS および Amazon Aurora で実行されているデータベースエンティティに適用される主要なメトリクスが含まれています。Amazon Managed Grafana で RDS/Aurora データベースの健全性と潜在的なパフォーマンスの問題を可視化および追跡するために、CloudWatch データソースを活用できます。 現在のところ、CloudWatch で利用できるのは基本的な Performance Insights メトリクスのみであり、データベースのパフォーマンスを分析し、ボトルネックを特定するには十分ではありません。Amazon Managed Grafana で RDS Performance Insights メトリクスを可視化し、単一のビューで可視性を確保するために、カスタム Lambda 関数を使用して RDS Performance Insights のすべてのメトリクスを収集し、カスタム CloudWatch メトリクス名前空間に公開できます。これらのメトリクスが Amazon CloudWatch で利用可能になると、Amazon Managed Grafana で可視化できます。 RDS Performance Insights メトリクスを収集するカスタム Lambda 関数をデプロイするには、以下の GitHub リポジトリをクローンし、install.sh スクリプトを実行します。 $ git clone https://github.com/aws-observability/observability-best-practices.git $ cd sandbox/monitor-aurora-with-grafana $ chmod +x install.sh $ ./install.sh

This enables trend analysis and supports proactive monitoring to detect issues before they impact users. To learn about Metrics in general and the features of Amazon CloudWatch for Metric collection and analysis visit Metrics in Amazon CloudWatch While many AWS services have the ability to publish infrastructure metrics out-of-the-box to Amazon CloudWatch, this section will focus on capturing custom metrics from .NET applications and transporting them to Amazon CloudWatch metric monitoring systems for analysis. Use CloudWatch PutMetricData API call through AWS SDK for .NET​ Include the Amazon.CloudWatch and Amazon.CloudWatch.Model NuGet packages in your code. using Amazon.CloudWatch; using Amazon.CloudWatch.Model; Build the PutMetricDataRequest object that contains the namespace, metric name and value, dimensions and dimension values. var request = new PutMetricDataRequest { Namespace = namespaceName, MetricData = new List<MetricDatum> { new MetricDatum { MetricName = metricName, Dimensions = new List<Dimension> { new Dimension { Name = dimensionName, Value = dimensionValue } }, Value = metricValue } } }; Send the metric data to Amazon CloudWatch by using the PutMetricData API call. using var client = new AmazonCloudWatchClient(); await client.PutMetricDataAsync(request); CloudWatch embedded metric format​ The CloudWatch embedded metric format (EMF) lets you create custom metrics asynchronously by writing logs to CloudWatch Logs. This approach allows you to: Embed custom metrics alongside detailed log event data Have CloudWatch automatically extract these metrics for visualization and alarming Enable real-time incident detection Query the associated detailed log events using CloudWatch Logs Insights Gain deep insights into the root causes of operational events Use cases for using EMF​ Generate custom metrics across compute environments Easily generate custom metrics from Lambda functions without requiring custom batching code, making blocking network requests or relying on 3rd party software. Other compute environments (EC2, On-prem, ECS, EKS, and other container environments) are supported by installing the CloudWatch Agent. Linking metrics to high cardinality context Using the Embedded Metric Format, you will be able to visualize and alarm on custom metrics, but also retain the original, detailed and high-cardinality context which is queryable using CloudWatch Logs Insights. For example, the library automatically injects environment metadata such as Lambda Function version, EC2 instance and image ids into the structured log event data. The aws-embedded-metrics-dotnet opensource repository has everything you need to get started. Installation​ Include the Amazon.CloudWatch.EMF NuGet package in your code using Amazon.CloudWatch.EMF You can instantiate a MetricsLogger that implements IDisposable and use it as shown below. The metrics will be flushed to the configured sink when the logger is disposed. Usage​ using (var logger = new MetricsLogger()) { logger.SetNamespace(\"Canary\"); var dimensionSet = new DimensionSet(); dimensionSet.AddDimension(\"Service\", \"aggregator\"); logger.SetDimensions(dimensionSet); logger.PutMetric(\"ProcessingLatency\", 100, Unit.MILLISECONDS,StorageResolution.STANDARD); logger.PutMetric(\"Memory.HeapUsed\", \"1600424.0\", Unit.BYTES, StorageResolution.HIGH); logger.PutProperty(\"RequestId\", \"422b1569-16f6-4a03-b8f0-fe3fd9b100f8\"); } ASP.NET Core​ We provide a helper package that helps with onboarding and provides default metrics for ASP.NET Core applications. Add the configuration to your Startup file. public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { // Add the necessary services. After this is done, you will have the // IMetricsLogger available for dependency injection in your // controllers services.AddEmf(); } Add middleware to add default metrics and metadata to each request public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // Add middleware which will set metric dimensions based on the request routing app.UseEmfMiddleware(); } In any environment, other than AWS Lambda, we recommend running an out-of-process agent (the CloudWatch Agent or FireLens / Fluent-Bit) to collect the EMF events. When using an out-of-process agent, this package will buffer the data asynchronously in process to handle any transient communication issues with the agent. このページを編集 前へ Logs 次へ Traces Use CloudWatch PutMetricData API call through AWS SDK for .NET CloudWatch embedded metric format","s":"Metrics","u":"/observability-best-practices/ja/guides/dotnet/aws-native/metrics","h":"","p":439},{"i":442,"t":"Guides .NET .NET AWS Native Logs このページの見出し Logs Logs provide rich, contextual information about events in your application. They are very essential for debugging and understanding why something went wrong. This section provides recipes that can be used as best practices for emitting and sending logs from .NET applications to the AWS' native log service - Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Stream logs from log files on Amazon EC2 instances or on-premises servers to Amazon CloudWatch Logs​ You can use this approach when your existing .NET applications write logs to log files and you want to use the Amazon CloudWatch logs for log storage and analysis without any changes to your code. Step 1: Install the CW Agent on the Amazon EC2 instance or the On-premises server where your application runs. Instructions for installing the CW Agent can be found here. Step 2: Next, we need to provide permissions to the CloudWatch agent to write logs to CloudWatch. You create an IAM role, an IAM user, or both to grant permissions that the CloudWatch agent needs to write logs to CloudWatch. If you're going to use the agent on Amazon EC2 instances, you must create an IAM role. If you're going to use the agent on on-premises servers, you must create an IAM user. CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy is an AWS managed IAM Policy that includes necessary permissions to write logs to CloudWatch. Follow these instructions to provide the permissions to the CW Agent. Step 3: Before running the CloudWatch agent on any servers, you must create one or more CloudWatch agent configuration files. The agent configuration file is a JSON file that specifies the metrics, logs, and traces that the agent is to collect and where to send them (like which log group or namespace in CloudWatch). You can create it by using a wizard or by creating it yourself from scratch. The agent configuration file has four sections: agent, metrics, logs, and traces. You can provide the credentails you created previously (step 2) in the agent section. The logs section specifies what log files are published to CloudWatch Logs. This can include events from the Windows Event Log if the server runs Windows Server. Detailed instructions to configure the agent and the logs sections can be found here. Step 4: Once you have all of the above things in place, you can start the CloudWatch agent. Use AWS SDK for .NET to write logs from .NET applications to CloudWatch Logs​ If you want to write logs directly to Amazon CloudWatch Logs using the service's APIs, you can do so by using the AWS SDK for .NET. AWS SDK for .NET provides libraries that make it easier to develop .NET applications that interact with AWS Services. The libraries are provided in the form of NuGet packages. To interact with AmazonCloudWatch Logs, you'll need to use the AmazonCloudWatchLogsClient class provided by the AWSSDK.CloudWatchLogs NuGet package. Step 1: Install the AWS CloudWatch Logs NuGet package dotnet add package AWSSDK.CloudWatchLogs Step 2: Set up AWS credentials Make sure your app has the necessary permissions to write to Cloud Watch Logs. Either through assigning an IAM role, using an AWS credentials file, or setting up environment variables. For example, the below policy provides permissions to create log groups and log streams as well as writing logs to them. { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"logs:CreateLogGroup\", \"logs:CreateLogStream\", \"logs:PutLogEvents\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\" } Step 3: Initialize the CloudWatchLogs Client. The below namespaces and classes are part of the AWSSDK.CloudWatchLogs NuGet package. using Amazon.CloudWatchLogs; using Amazon.CloudWatchLogs.Model; var client = new AmazonCloudWatchLogsClient(); Step 4: Create a Log Group and Log Stream if needed. You can read more about these Amazon CloudWatch Logs concepts like Log groups and Log streams here string logGroupName = \"MyAppLogGroup\"; string logStreamName = \"MyAppLogStream\"; // Create Log Group (skip if already exists) try { await client.CreateLogGroupAsync(new CreateLogGroupRequest { LogGroupName = logGroupName }); } catch (ResourceAlreadyExistsException) { } // Create Log Stream (skip if already exists) try { await client.CreateLogStreamAsync(new CreateLogStreamRequest { LogGroupName = logGroupName, LogStreamName = logStreamName }); } catch (ResourceAlreadyExistsException) { } Step 5: Send your logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs var logEvents = new List<InputLogEvent> { new InputLogEvent { Message = \"Hello CloudWatch from .NET!\", Timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow } }; var putLogRequest = new PutLogEventsRequest { LogGroupName = logGroupName, LogStreamName = logStreamName, LogEvents = logEvents }; await client.PutLogEventsAsync(putLogRequest); Use popular .NET logging frameworks to send structured logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs​ Although using the AmazonCloudWatchLogsClient provides a lot of flexibility and low-level API access to CloudWatch Logs, it results in a significant amount of boilerplate code. Additionally, there are several popular third-party logging frameworks among the .NET developer community for structured logging that the AmazonCloudWatchLogsClient does not integrate with out-of-the-box. The aws-logging-dotnet repository contains plugins for many of these popular logging framework providers to integrate with Amazon CloudWatch Logs. The repository contains detailed information on how to wire up your application that uses the standard ASP.NET ILogger framework, NLog, Apache log4net, or Serilog to send logs to AmazonCloudWatch Logs.

In this section, you will see links to AWS Documention and open source repositories that will provide information on using AWS X-Ray SDK for .NET to instrument .NET applications to create and send trace information to AWS X-Ray via X-Ray daemon. To learn about AWS X-Ray it's core concepts visit the What is AWS X-Ray and Concepts sections in the AWS X-Ray Developer Guide. The X-Ray SDK for .NET is a library for instrumenting C# .NET web applications, .NET Core web applications, and .NET Core functions on AWS Lambda. It provides classes and methods for generating and sending trace data to the X-Ray daemon. This includes information about incoming requests served by the application, and calls that the application makes to downstream AWS services, HTTP web APIs, and SQL databases. Options for agents and SDKs​ You have the option to choose between AWS X-Ray daemon, Cloudwatch agent, and AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) collector to collect traces from Amazon EC2 instances and on-premise servers and send them to AWS X-Ray. Choose the right one for your usecase so you minimize the number of agents you have to manage. To learn about configuring X-Ray daemon to collect and send traces from your application and infrastructure read the AWS X-Ray daemon guide. Instead, if your choice is to use CloudWatch agent, the Amazon CloudWatch user guide will provide the instructions to setup and configure CloudWatch agent. To instrument your application to generate traces, you have the option to choose between OpenTelemetry and X-Ray SDK for .NET. The guidance to choose between these options is available here. AWS X-Ray SDK for .NET​ The X-Ray SDK for .NET is an open source project. X-Ray SDK for .NET is supported for applications targeting .NET Framework 4.5 or later. For .NET Core applications, the SDK requires .NET Core 2.0 or later. Here are the links for you to get started.

While other platforms require OpenTelemetry to provide complete telemetry APIs, .NET already offers robust built-in mechanisms through its platform APIs for logging, metrics, and activities. The OpenTelemetry .NET implementation simply leverages these native components (like System.Diagnostics) rather than creating new ones. This means library authors can use the standard .NET APIs they're already familiar with, and OpenTelemetry seamlessly integrates with these existing instrumentation points. OpenTelementry Libraries​ OpenTelemetry in .NET is structured around three fundamental package categories: The Core API packages provide the essential foundation and base functionality, including core interfaces and implementations for telemetry collection. Instrumentation packages automatically collect telemetry data from various .NET components and popular libraries, capturing metrics, traces, and logs from sources like ASP.NET Core, HTTP clients, and Entity Framework. Exporter packages serve as bridges to different observability platforms, allowing you to send your collected telemetry data to various destinations such as Jaeger, Prometheus, or any system supporting the OTLP protocol. These components work together as a cohesive system, available through NuGet, to provide a complete observability solution for .NET applications. The table below describes these packages. Package Description OpenTelemetry Main OTEL library that provides the core functionality OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore Instrumentation for ASP.NET Core and Kestrel OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.GrpcNetClient Instrumentation for gRPC Client OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http Instrumentation for HttpClient and HttpWebRequest classes OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.SqlClient Instrumentation for SqlClient used to trace database operations like Entity Framework Core OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console Exporter using the OTLP protocol OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol Exporter using the OTLP protocol OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Prometheus.AspNetCore Exporter for Prometheus implemented using an ASP.NET Core endpoint OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Zipkin Exporter for Zipkin tracing AWS .NET OpenTelemetry Libraries​ AWS released their latest iteration of OpenTelemetry packages which are available in NuGet.

Traces Implementation​ Configuring OpenTelemetry tracing in a .NET application is straightforward: builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry() .WithTracing(tracing => tracing .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation() .AddHttpClientInstrumentation() .AddEntityFrameworkCoreInstrumentation() .AddSource(\"MyApplication.Tracing\") .AddOtlpExporter()); A key strength of .NET's OpenTelemetry implementation is automatic instrumentation. Many common libraries and frameworks—including ASP.NET Core, HttpClient, gRPC, and Entity Framework Core—emit traces without requiring additional code. This provides immediate visibility into external calls and database operations. Custom Traces​ Creating custom traces in application code uses the ActivitySource API: // Create a source once and reuse it private static readonly ActivitySource MyActivitySource = new(\"MyApplication.Tracing\"); // Create spans for important operations using var activity = MyActivitySource.StartActivity(\"ProcessOrder\"); activity?.SetTag(\"orderId\", orderId); // Child operations create nested spans using var childActivity = MyActivitySource.StartActivity(\"ValidatePayment\"); Registering your ActivitySource in dependency injection is considered a best practice for OpenTelemetry tracing in .NET applications. // During service configuration services.AddSingleton(sp => new ActivitySource(\"MyCompany.MyApplication\", \"1.0.0\")); // Or create a wrapper service if you need more functionality services.AddSingleton<TracingService>(); // Then inject it where needed public class OrderProcessor { private readonly ActivitySource _activitySource; public OrderProcessor(ActivitySource activitySource) { _activitySource = activitySource; } public void ProcessOrder(Order order) { using var activity = _activitySource.StartActivity(\"ProcessOrder\"); activity?.SetTag(\"orderId\", order.Id); // Processing logic } } このページを編集 前へ Metrics 次へ OpenTelemetry with .NET Traces Implementation Custom Traces","s":"Tracing","u":"/observability-best-practices/ja/guides/dotnet/oss/traces","h":"","p":455},{"i":458,"t":"フルスタック このページを編集","s":"フルスタック","u":"/observability-best-practices/ja/guides/full-stack","h":"","p":457},{"i":460,"t":"Guides .NET .NET Open Source OpenTelemetry with .NET このページの見出し OpenTelemetry with .NET OpenTelemetry in .NET stands out from implementations in other languages because it builds upon the framework's existing instrumentation capabilities. While other platforms require OpenTelemetry to provide complete telemetry APIs, .NET already offers robust built-in mechanisms through its platform APIs for logging, metrics, and activities. The OpenTelemetry .NET implementation simply leverages these native components (like System.Diagnostics) rather than creating new ones. This means library authors can use the standard .NET APIs they're already familiar with, and OpenTelemetry seamlessly integrates with these existing instrumentation points. OpenTelementry Libraries​ OpenTelemetry in .NET is structured around three fundamental package categories: The Core API packages provide the essential foundation and base functionality, including core interfaces and implementations for telemetry collection. Instrumentation packages automatically collect telemetry data from various .NET components and popular libraries, capturing metrics, traces, and logs from sources like ASP.NET Core, HTTP clients, and Entity Framework. Exporter packages serve as bridges to different observability platforms, allowing you to send your collected telemetry data to various destinations such as Jaeger, Prometheus, or any system supporting the OTLP protocol. These components work together as a cohesive system, available through NuGet, to provide a complete observability solution for .NET applications. The table below describes these packages. Package Description OpenTelemetry Main OTEL library that provides the core functionality OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore Instrumentation for ASP.NET Core and Kestrel OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.GrpcNetClient Instrumentation for gRPC Client OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http Instrumentation for HttpClient and HttpWebRequest classes OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.SqlClient Instrumentation for SqlClient used to trace database operations like Entity Framework Core OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console Exporter using the OTLP protocol OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol Exporter using the OTLP protocol OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Prometheus.AspNetCore Exporter for Prometheus implemented using an ASP.NET Core endpoint OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Zipkin Exporter for Zipkin tracing AWS .NET OpenTelemetry Libraries​ AWS released their latest iteration of OpenTelemetry packages which are available in NuGet. The packages have been reworked for simplicity and to conform to the latest OpenTelemetry naming conventions. They include new features like support for enhanced observability in AWS SDK for .NET and additional instrumentation for AWS services, including Amazon Bedrock, as well as multiple bug fixes, enhancements and contributions by the OpenTelemetry community. The table below describes these packages. Package Description OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AWS Enhances metrics and tracing calls with additional data about AWS services while using AWS SDK for .NET. OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AWSLambda SDK methods to instrument AWS Lambda Handler to create incoming spans OpenTelemetry.Resources.AWS AWS specific resource detectors to enhance telemetry with metadata based on where your application is running. Includes support for Amazon EC2, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) OpenTelemetry.Extensions.AWS Supports Trace

継続的なモニタリングとオブザーバビリティは、クラウド環境のアジリティを高め、カスタマーエクスペリエンスを向上させ、リスクを軽減します。 Wikipedia によると、オブザーバビリティ とは、システムの外部出力の知識から、システムの内部状態をどの程度推測できるかを示す指標です。 オブザーバビリティという用語自体は制御理論の分野に由来し、基本的にはシステムが生成する外部シグナルや出力を学習することで、システム内のコンポーネントの内部状態を推測できることを意味します。 モニタリングとオブザーバビリティの違いは、モニタリングがシステムが機能しているかどうかを示すのに対し、オブザーバビリティはシステムが機能していない理由を示すことです。 モニタリングは通常、事後対応的な手段ですが、オブザーバビリティの目標は、主要業績評価指標を事前対応的に改善できるようにすることです。 システムは観察されない限り、制御や最適化することはできません。 メトリクス、ログ、トレースの収集によってワークロードを計測し、適切なモニタリングとオブザーバビリティツールを使用して意味のある洞察と詳細なコンテキストを得ることで、お客様は環境を制御および最適化できます。 AWS は、お客様がモニタリングからオブザーバビリティへと移行し、エンドツーエンドのサービス可視性を実現できるようにします。 この記事では、Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) と、AWS ネイティブおよびオープンソースツールを通じて AWS クラウド環境におけるサービスのモニタリングとオブザーバビリティを改善するためのベストプラクティスに焦点を当てます。 Amazon EC2​ Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) は、Amazon Web Services (AWS) クラウドにおける高度にスケーラブルなコンピューティングプラットフォームです。 Amazon EC2 は、ハードウェアへの初期投資の必要性を排除し、使用した分だけ支払うことで、お客様はより迅速にアプリケーションを開発およびデプロイできます。 EC2 が提供する主な機能には、インスタンスと呼ばれる仮想コンピューティング環境、Amazon マシンイメージと呼ばれるインスタンスの事前設定済みテンプレート、インスタンスタイプとして利用可能な CPU、メモリ、ストレージ、ネットワーク容量などのさまざまなリソース構成があります。 AWS ネイティブツールを使用したモニタリングとオブザーバビリティ​ Amazon CloudWatch​ Amazon CloudWatch は、AWS、ハイブリッド、オンプレミスのアプリケーションとインフラストラクチャリソースのデータと実用的なインサイトを提供する、モニタリングと管理のサービスです。 CloudWatch は、ログ、メトリクス、イベントの形式でモニタリングと運用データを収集します。 また、AWS リソース、アプリケーション、AWS およびオンプレミスサーバーで実行されるサービスの統合されたビューを提供します。 CloudWatch は、リソース使用率、アプリケーションパフォーマンス、運用状態についてシステム全体の可視性を得るのに役立ちます。 統合された CloudWatch エージェント​ 統合された CloudWatch エージェントは、x86-64 および ARM64 アーキテクチャを使用するほとんどのオペレーティングシステムをサポートする MIT ライセンスのオープンソースソフトウェアです。 CloudWatch エージェントは、オペレーティングシステム全体で Amazon EC2 インスタンスとハイブリッド環境のオンプレミスサーバーからシステムレベルのメトリクスを収集し、アプリケーションやサービスからカスタムメトリクスを取得し、Amazon EC2 インスタンスとオンプレミスサーバーからログを収集するのに役立ちます。 Amazon EC2 インスタンスへの CloudWatch エージェントのインストール​ コマンドラインでのインストール​ CloudWatch エージェントはコマンドラインを通じてインストールできます。 様々なアーキテクチャと様々なオペレーティングシステム用の必要なパッケージはダウンロードできます。 CloudWatch エージェントが Amazon EC2 インスタンスから情報を読み取り、CloudWatch に書き込むための権限を提供する必要な IAM ロールを作成します。 必要な IAM ロールを作成したら、必要な Amazon EC2 インスタンスで CloudWatch エージェントをインストールして実行できます。 備考 ドキュメント: コマンドラインを使用した CloudWatch エージェントのインストール AWS Observability ワークショップ: CloudWatch エージェントのセットアップとインストール

で統合されたオブザーバビリティを実現するために同様のアプローチを取ることができます。CloudWatch エージェントは Amazon S3 から直接、または AWS Systems Manager を通じてダウンロードできます。オンプレミスサーバーから Amazon CloudWatch にデータを送信するための IAM ユーザーを作成します。オンプレミスサーバーにエージェントをインストールして起動します。 注記 ドキュメント: Installing the CloudWatch agent on on-premises servers Amazon CloudWatch を使用した Amazon EC2 インスタンスのモニタリング​ Amazon EC2 インスタンスとアプリケーションの信頼性、可用性、パフォーマンスを維持するための重要な側面は、継続的なモニタリング です。 必要な Amazon EC2 インスタンスに CloudWatch エージェントをインストールすることで、安定した環境を維持するためにインスタンスの健全性とパフォーマンスをモニタリングすることが必要です。 ベースラインとして、CPU 使用率、ネットワーク使用率、ディスクパフォーマンス、ディスクの読み書き、メモリ使用率、ディスクスワップ使用率、ディスク容量使用率、ページファイル使用率、EC2 インスタンスのログ収集などのモニタリングが推奨されます。 基本モニタリングと詳細モニタリング​ Amazon CloudWatch は、Amazon EC2 から生データを収集し、読みやすいリアルタイムに近いメトリクスに処理します。 デフォルトでは、Amazon EC2 はインスタンスの基本モニタリングとして、5 分間隔でメトリクスデータを CloudWatch に送信します。 インスタンスのメトリクスデータを 1 分間隔で CloudWatch に送信するには、インスタンスで詳細モニタリングを有効にすることができます。 モニタリングのための自動化ツールと手動ツール​ AWS は、Amazon EC2 をモニタリングし、問題が発生した際に報告するための自動化ツールと手動ツールの 2 種類のツールを提供しています。 これらのツールの一部は簡単な設定が必要で、一部は手動での操作が必要です。 自動化モニタリングツール には、AWS システムステータスチェック、インスタンスステータスチェック、Amazon CloudWatch アラーム、Amazon EventBridge、Amazon CloudWatch Logs、CloudWatch エージェント、AWS Management Pack for Microsoft System Center Operations Manager が含まれます。 手動モニタリング ツールには、この記事の後のセクションで詳しく説明するダッシュボードが含まれます。 注記 ドキュメント: 自動化および手動モニタリング CloudWatch エージェントを使用した Amazon EC2 インスタンスからのメトリクス​ メトリクスは CloudWatch の基本的な概念です。メトリクスは、CloudWatch に公開される時系列のデータポイントのセットを表します。メトリクスは監視する変数として、データポイントはその変数の時間経過による値として考えることができます。例えば、特定の EC2 インスタンスの CPU 使用率は、Amazon EC2 が提供するメトリクスの 1 つです。 CloudWatch エージェントを使用したデフォルトメトリクス​ Amazon CloudWatch は Amazon EC2 インスタンスからメトリクスを収集し、AWS マネジメントコンソール、AWS CLI、または API を通じて確認できます。利用可能なメトリクスは、基本モニタリングでは 5 分間隔、詳細モニタリング（有効化時）では 1 分間隔でデータポイントが収集されます。 CloudWatch エージェントを使用したカスタムメトリクス​ お客様は、API または CLI を使用して、1 分間隔の標準解像度または 1 秒間隔までの高解像度で、独自のカスタムメトリクスを CloudWatch に公開することもできます。 統合された CloudWatch エージェントは、StatsD と collectd を通じてカスタムメトリクスの取得をサポートしています。 アプリケーションやサービスからのカスタムメトリクスは、StatsD プロトコルを使用した CloudWatch エージェントで取得できます。 StatsD は、さまざまなアプリケーションからメトリクスを収集できる一般的なオープンソースソリューションです。 StatsD は、Linux と Windows の両方のサーバーをサポートしており、独自のメトリクスを計測するのに特に便利です。 アプリケーションやサービスからのカスタムメトリクスは、collectd プロトコルを使用した CloudWatch エージェントでも取得できます。 collectd は、Linux サーバーのみをサポートする一般的なオープンソースソリューションで、さまざまなアプリケーションのシステム統計情報を収集できるプラグインを備えています。 CloudWatch エージェントがすでに収集できるシステムメトリクスと、collectd からの追加メトリクスを組み合わせることで、システムとアプリケーションのモニタリング、分析、トラブルシューティングをより効果的に行うことができます。 CloudWatch エージェントを使用した追加のカスタムメトリクス​ CloudWatch エージェントは、EC2 インスタンスからカスタムメトリクスを収集することをサポートしています。 代表的な例をいくつか紹介します： Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) を使用する Linux 上の EC2 インスタンスのネットワークパフォーマンスメトリクス。 Linux サーバーからの Nvidia GPU メトリクス。 Linux および Windows サーバー上の個々のプロセスから procstat プラグインを使用したプロセスメトリクス。 CloudWatch エージェントを使用した Amazon EC2 インスタンスからのログ​ Amazon CloudWatch Logs は、既存のシステム、アプリケーション、カスタムログファイルを使用して、ほぼリアルタイムでシステムとアプリケーションの監視とトラブルシューティングを行うことができます。Amazon EC2 インスタンスやオンプレミスサーバーからのログを CloudWatch に収集するには、統合された CloudWatch エージェントをインストールする必要があります。最新の統合された CloudWatch エージェントは、ログと高度なメトリクスの両方を収集でき、さまざまなオペレーティングシステムをサポートしているため、推奨されています。インスタンスがインスタンスメタデータサービスバージョン 2 (IMDSv2) を使用している場合は、統合されたエージェントが必要です。 統合された CloudWatch エージェントによって収集されたログは、処理されて Amazon CloudWatch Logs に保存されます。Windows サーバーや Linux サーバー、Amazon EC2 とオンプレミスサーバーの両方からログを収集できます。CloudWatch エージェントの設定ウィザードを使用して、CloudWatch エージェントのセットアップを定義する設定 JSON ファイルを作成できます。 注記 AWS Observability Workshop: Logs Amazon EC2 インスタンスイベント​ イベントは、AWS 環境の変更を示します。AWS リソースとアプリケーションは、状態が変化したときにイベントを生成できます。CloudWatch Events は、AWS リソースとアプリケーションの変更を説明するシステムイベントをほぼリアルタイムで提供します。例えば、Amazon EC2 は EC2 インスタンスの状態が pending から running に変更されたときにイベントを生成します。また、カスタムのアプリケーションレベルのイベントを生成し、CloudWatch Events に発行することもできます。 お客様は、ステータスチェックと予定されたイベントを確認することで、Amazon EC2 インスタンスのステータスを監視できます。ステータスチェックは、Amazon EC2 が実行する自動チェックの結果を提供します。これらの自動チェックは、インスタンスに影響を与える特定の問題を検出します。ステータスチェック情報は、Amazon CloudWatch が提供するデータと共に、各インスタンスの詳細な運用可視性を提供します。 Amazon EC2 インスタンスイベント用の Amazon EventBridge ルール​ Amazon CloudWatch Events は Amazon EventBridge を使用して、リソースの変更や問題などのシステムイベントに自動的に対応することができます。 Amazon EC2 を含む AWS サービスからのイベントは、ほぼリアルタイムで CloudWatch Events に配信され、イベントがルールに一致した場合に適切なアクションを実行するための EventBridge ルールを作成できます。 アクションには、AWS Lambda 関数の呼び出し、Amazon EC2 Run Command の呼び出し、Amazon Kinesis Data Streams へのイベントの中継、AWS Step Functions ステートマシンの有効化、Amazon SNS トピックへの通知、Amazon SQS キューへの通知、内部または外部のインシデント対応アプリケーションや SIEM ツールへの送信などがあります。 注記 AWS Observability ワークショップ: インシデント対応 - EventBridge ルール Amazon EC2 インスタンスの Amazon CloudWatch アラーム​ CloudWatch アラーム は、指定した期間にわたってメトリクスを監視し、一定期間にわたってメトリクスの値が指定したしきい値に対してどのような状態かに基づいて、1 つ以上のアクションを実行できます。 アラームは、状態が変化した場合にのみアクションを実行します。 アクションには、Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) トピックへの通知の送信や Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling、EC2 インスタンスの停止、終了、再起動、復旧 などの適切なアクションを含めることができます。 アラームがトリガーされると、アクションとして SNS トピックにメール通知が送信されます。 Auto Scaling インスタンスのモニタリング​ Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling は、アプリケーションの負荷を処理するために適切な数の Amazon EC2 インスタンスを確保できるようにします。 Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling メトリクス は Auto Scaling グループに関する情報を収集し、AWS/AutoScaling 名前空間に格納されます。 Auto Scaling インスタンスの CPU やその他の使用状況を表す Amazon EC2 インスタンスメトリクスは、AWS/EC2 名前空間に格納されます。 CloudWatch でのダッシュボード作成​ AWS アカウントのリソースの詳細な情報、リソースのパフォーマンス、ヘルスチェックを把握することは、安定したリソース管理にとって重要です。 Amazon CloudWatch ダッシュボード は、CloudWatch コンソールでカスタマイズ可能なホームページです。 異なるリージョンに分散しているリソースであっても、1 つのビューで監視することができます。 利用可能な Amazon EC2 インスタンスの詳細を把握するための方法があります。 CloudWatch の自動ダッシュボード​ 自動ダッシュボードは、すべての AWS パブリックリージョンで利用可能で、CloudWatch の下にある Amazon EC2 インスタンスを含むすべての AWS リソースの健全性とパフォーマンスの集約ビューを提供します。

は OpenTelemetry 形式のメトリクスを CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF) に変換します。これにより、OpenTelemetry メトリクスと統合されたアプリケーションが、高カーディナリティのアプリケーションメトリクスを CloudWatch に送信できるようになります。X-Ray エクスポーター は、OTLP 形式で収集されたトレースを AWS X-ray にエクスポートすることができます。 Amazon EC2 上の ADOT Collector は、AWS CloudFormation または AWS Systems Manager Distributor を使用してインストールし、アプリケーションメトリクスを収集できます。 Prometheus を使用した Amazon EC2 インスタンスのモニタリング​ Prometheus は、システムのモニタリングとアラートのためのスタンドアロンのオープンソースプロジェクトで、独立して保守されています。 Prometheus は、メトリクスを時系列データとして収集・保存します。つまり、メトリクス情報は記録された時のタイムスタンプと、ラベルと呼ばれるオプションのキーバリューペアとともに保存されます。 Prometheus は、コマンドラインフラグを介して設定され、すべての設定の詳細は prometheus.yaml ファイルで管理されています。 設定ファイル内の 'scrape_config' セクションは、スクレイピング対象とそのパラメータを指定します。 Prometheus Service Discovery (SD) は、メトリクスをスクレイピングするエンドポイントを見つけるための手法です。 Amazon EC2 サービスディスカバリの設定により、AWS EC2 インスタンスからスクレイピング対象を取得することができ、これは ec2_sd_config で設定されます。 Prometheus と Amazon CloudWatch を介したメトリクス​ EC2 インスタンスの CloudWatch エージェントは、Prometheus をインストールして設定することで、CloudWatch でのモニタリング用のメトリクスをスクレイピングできます。これは、EC2 上のコンテナワークロードを好み、オープンソースの Prometheus モニタリングと互換性のあるカスタムメトリクスを必要とするお客様に役立ちます。CloudWatch エージェントのインストールは、前述のセクションで説明した手順に従って実行できます。Prometheus モニタリング機能を持つ CloudWatch エージェントは、Prometheus メトリクスをスクレイピングするために 2 つの設定が必要です。1 つは、Prometheus ドキュメントの 'scrape_config' に記載されている標準的な Prometheus の設定です。もう 1 つは、CloudWatch エージェントの設定です。 Prometheus と ADOT Collector を介したメトリクス​ お客様は、オブザーバビリティのニーズに対して、すべてオープンソースのセットアップを選択できます。 そのために、AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Collector を設定して、Prometheus で計装されたアプリケーションからメトリクスを収集し、Prometheus サーバーに送信することができます。 このフローには、3 つの OpenTelemetry コンポーネントが関与しています。それらは、Prometheus Receiver、Prometheus Remote Write Exporter、Sigv4 Authentication Extension です。 Prometheus Receiver は Prometheus 形式でメトリクスデータを受信します。 Prometheus Exporter は Prometheus 形式でデータをエクスポートします。 Sigv4 Authenticator 拡張機能は、AWS サービスへのリクエストに Sigv4 認証を提供します。 Prometheus Node Exporter​ Prometheus Node Exporter は、クラウド環境向けのオープンソースの時系列モニタリングおよびアラートシステムです。 Amazon EC2 インスタンスに Node

マルチクラウドとは、複数のクラウドサービスプロバイダーを同時に使用してワークロードを運用することを指し、ハイブリッドとは、オンプレミスとクラウド環境の両方にワークロードを拡張することを指します。 ハイブリッドおよびマルチクラウド環境におけるオブザーバビリティは、ツールの多様性、レイテンシー、異種ワークロードにより、大きな複雑さを伴う可能性があります。 それにもかかわらず、これは開発者とビジネスユーザーの両方にとって共通の目標であり続けています。 この目標を達成するために、豊富な製品とサービスのエコシステムが存在します。 しかし、クラウドネイティブなワークロードに対するオブザーバビリティツールの有用性は、大きく異なる場合があります。 コンテナ化されたバッチ処理ワークロードと、サーバーレスフレームワークを使用するリアルタイムバンキングアプリケーションのモニタリング要件の違いを考えてみましょう。 両者ともログ、メトリクス、トレースを持っていますが、それらを観察するためのツールチェーンは、クラウドネイティブ、オープンソース、ISV 製品など、さまざまな選択肢があります。 Prometheus のようなオープンソースツールが一方に適している一方で、マネージドサービスとして提供されるクラウドネイティブツールが要件をより良く満たす場合もあります。 これにマルチクラウドとハイブリッドの複雑さが加わると、アプリケーションからの洞察を得ることはさらに困難になります。 これらの追加された次元に対処し、オブザーバビリティへのアプローチを容易にするため、お客様は統一されたインターフェースを持つ単一のツールチェーンに投資する傾向があります。 結局のところ、シグナルとノイズの比率を下げることは通常良いことです！ しかし、単一のアプローチがすべてのユースケースに適用できるわけではなく、さまざまなプラットフォームの運用モデルが混乱を招く可能性があります。 私たちの目標は、お客様のニーズを補完し、問題が発生した際の平均修復時間を短縮するための情報に基づいた決定を支援することです。 以下は、あらゆる規模、すべての業界のお客様との協業を通じて学んだベストプラクティスです。 ヒント これらのベストプラクティスは、エンタープライズアーキテクト、開発者、DevOps など、幅広い役割を対象としています。 組織のビジネスニーズと、分散環境におけるオブザーバビリティがどれだけの価値を提供できるかという観点から、これらを評価することをお勧めします。 ツールに判断を左右されないようにする​ アプリケーション、ツール、プロセスは、売上や顧客満足度の向上などのビジネス成果を達成するために存在します。 適切な技術戦略とは、これらのビジネス目標の達成を可能な限り支援するものです。 しかし、目標達成を支援するものは単なるツールであり、戦略を支援するためのものであって、戦略そのものではありません。 たとえば、家を建てる必要がある場合、ツールに設計や建築方法を尋ねることはしません。 むしろ、ツールは目的を達成するための手段なのです。 単一の同質な環境では、ツールに関する判断は比較的容易です。 結局のところ、1 つの環境で単一のアプリケーションを実行する場合、ツールは全体で同じものを簡単に使用できます。 しかし、ハイブリッドおよびマルチクラウド環境では状況はより複雑になり、ビジネス成果と、これらの環境全体でワークロードを監視することによって得られる価値に注目することが重要です。 各クラウドサービスプロバイダー (CSP) には独自のネイティブなオブザーバビリティソリューションがあり、利用可能なパートナーや独立系ソフトウェアベンダー (ISV) も豊富に存在します。 複数の環境で運用しているからといって、すべてのワークロードに単一のツールを使用することが推奨されるわけではありません。 これは、ワークロードを監視するために複数のサービス、フレームワーク、またはプロバイダーを使用する可能性があることを意味します。 運用モデルがニーズを反映する必要がある方法の詳細については、以下の「ワークロードのコンテキストの方が単一の管理画面よりも重要」を参照してください。 いずれにせよ、ツールを実装する際は、将来オブザーバビリティソリューションを進化させることができるように「Two-way doors」を作成することを忘れないでください。 以下は、避けるべき「ツール優先」の結果の例です： 将来のアップグレードや新しいソリューションへの移行のための Two-way door なしに単一のツールの実装に焦点を当てると、回避可能な技術的負債が生じる可能性があります。 これは、ツールがソリューションとなり、いつの日か解決が必要な問題となる可能性があるときに発生します。 ボリュームディスカウントにより単一のツールを使用する企業標準は、有益な機能を得られない可能性があります。 これは「品質よりもコスト」となり、意図せずモノリシックなアンチパターンを生み出す可能性があります。 ボリュームしきい値以下を維持するためにテレメトリの収集を抑制し、結果としてオブザーバビリティツールの使用を妨げる可能性があります。 ログとメトリクスのコレクターは充実しているものの、既存のトレース収集インフラストラクチャがないためにテレメトリの種類全体（通常はトレース）を収集しないことは、不完全なオブザーバビリティソリューションにつながる可能性があります。 労働コストとトレーニングコストを削減したいという理由で、サポートスタッフが単一のツールチェーンのみのトレーニングを受けることで、他のオブザーバビリティパターンの潜在的な価値が低下する可能性があります。 備考 ツールがオブザーバビリティ戦略を決定している場合は、アプローチを逆転させる必要があります。 ツールはオブザーバビリティを実現し、強化するためのものであり、選択肢を制限するものではありません。 備考 ツールの乱立は企業が苦労している実際の問題ですが、単一のツールチェーンへの急激な移行も同様にオブザーバビリティソリューションの有用性を低下させる可能性があります。 ハイブリッドおよびマルチクラウドのワークロードには、各プラットフォーム固有のテクノロジーがあり、各 CSP の高度なサービスは有用です。 ただし、単一ソース製品を使用することのトレードオフには、価値に基づく分析が必要です。 これらのリスクの一部を軽減するアプローチについては、「OpenTelemetry への投資」を参照してください。 オブザーバビリティデータには重力がある​ すべてのデータには重力があります。つまり、ワークロード、ソリューション、ツール、人、プロセス、プロジェクトを引き寄せる力があるということです。 例えば、顧客の取引データを含むデータベースは、コンピューティングや分析ワークロードを引き寄せる引力となります。 これは、ワークロードをどこに配置するか、どの環境で実行するか、そしてどのように運用していくかに直接的な影響を与えます。 同様のことがオブザーバビリティのシグナルにも当てはまりますが、このデータが生み出す重力は、ワークロードと組織のコンテキストに結びついています（「シングルペインオブグラスはワークロードのコンテキストほど重要ではない」を参照）。 オブザーバビリティのテレメトリのコンテキストを、その基盤となるワークロードやデータから完全に切り離すことはできません。 同じルールがここでも適用されます。テレメトリはデータであり、重力を持っています。 これは、テレメトリエージェント、コレクター、またはシグナルを集約・分析するシステムをどこに配置するかに影響を与えるべきです。 ヒント オブザーバビリティデータの時間経過に伴う価値は、他のほとんどのデータタイプと比べてかなり低くなります。 これをオブザーバビリティデータの「半減期」と呼ぶこともできます。 テレメトリを別の環境に中継する際の追加レイテンシーを、データ使用前の強制的な価値低下と考え、問題発生時のアラート要件と比較検討してください。 備考 ベストプラクティスは、データの集約によってビジネス価値が得られる場合にのみ、環境間でデータを送信することです。 データクエリのための単一のソースを持つことだけでは、多くのビジネスニーズを解決することはできず、より高価なソリューションや障害点の増加を招く可能性があります。 シングルペインオブグラスよりもワークロードのコンテキストが重要​ 「シングルペインオブグラス」でワークロードを全て監視したいという要望は一般的です。これは、できるだけシンプルな方法で可能な限り多くのデータを表示し、混乱やフラストレーション、診断時間を減らしたいという自然な欲求から生まれます。オブザーバビリティソリューション全体を一度に見るためのインターフェースを作成することは有用ですが、テレメトリーデータをそのコンテキストから切り離してしまうというトレードオフが生じる可能性があります。 例えば、100 台のサーバーの CPU 使用率を表示するダッシュボードは、消費量の異常なスパイクを示すかもしれませんが、なぜこれが発生したのか、またはこの動作に寄与する要因が何であるかを説明することはできません。また、このメトリクスの重要性が即座には明確にならない可能性があります。 時として、お客様がシングルペインオブグラスを過度に追求するあまり、ビジネスのコンテキストが失われ、1 つのツールで全てを見ようとすることで、データの価値が実際には希薄化してしまうケースを見てきました。ダッシュボードとツールはストーリーを語る必要があります。そしてこのストーリーには、ワークロードのイベントによって影響を受けるビジネスメトリクスと成果を含める必要があります。 さらに、ツールは運用モデルに合わせる必要があります。シングルペインオブグラスは、サポートチームがグローバルで全ての環境にアクセスできる場合に価値を付加できますが、単一のワークロード、単一の CSP またはハイブリッド環境にのみアクセスが制限されている場合、このアプローチによる付加価値はありません。このような場合、チームが各環境でネイティブにダッシュボードを作成できるようにすることで、価値実現までの時間を短縮し、将来の変更にも柔軟に対応できる可能性があります。 備考 オブザーバビリティデータの価値は、それが生成されたアプリケーションと深く統合されています。テレメトリーデータには、その環境から得られるコンテキストの認識が必要です。ハイブリッドおよびマルチクラウド環境では、技術の違いによってコンテキストの必要性がさらに高まります（ただし、Kubernetes のようなシステムは、異なるクラウドプロバイダーやオンプレミス間で類似している場合があります）。 備考 分散システム用のシングルペインオブグラスを構築する際は、ビジネスメトリクスと Service Level Objectives (SLOs) を、これらの SLOs に寄与する他のデータ（インフラストラクチャメトリクスなど）と同じビューに表示してください。これにより、他の方法では欠けているかもしれないコンテキストが提供されます。 ヒント シングルペインオブグラスは、テレメトリーデータの意味を保持できる場合に限り、問題の迅速な診断と検知時間（MTTD）、そして平均解決時間（MTTR）の短縮に役立ちます。これがなければ、シングルペインオブグラスアプローチは価値実現までの時間を増加させ、運用チームにとってマイナスの効果をもたらす可能性があります。 備考 シングルペインオブグラスの価値が判断できない場合、またはワークロードが完全に単一の CSP やオンプレミス環境に限定されている場合は、トップレベルのビジネスメトリクスのみをシングルペインオブグラスにロールアップし、生のメトリクスや他の寄与要因は元の環境に残すことを検討してください。 OpenTelemetry への投資​ オブザーバビリティベンダーの世界において、OpenTelemetry (OTel) は事実上の標準となっています。 OTel は、各種のテレメトリーデータを 1 つまたは複数のコレクターにマーシャリングできます。 これには、クラウドネイティブサービスや、さまざまな SaaS および ISV 製品が含まれます。 OTel エージェントとコレクターは OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) を使用して通信を行い、シグナルを多様なデプロイパターンを可能にする形式にカプセル化します。 最も価値のあるトランザクショントレースを、ビジネスとインフラストラクチャのコンテキストとともに収集するには、アプリケーションにトレース収集を統合する必要があります。 一部の自動計装エージェントは、ほとんど労力をかけずにこれを実行できます。 ただし、より高度なユースケースでは、トランザクショントレースをサポートするためにコードの変更が必要です。 これにより技術的負債が生まれ、ワークロードが特定の技術に縛られることになります。 OTel は、スパンという概念を使用してログ、メトリクス、トレースを収集します。 スパンには、単一のトランザクションからグループ化されたこれらのシグナルが含まれ、コンテキスト化された検索可能なオブジェクトにパッケージ化されます。 これにより、単一のアプリケーションイベントからのシグナルを 1 つのシンプルなエンティティとして表示できます。 たとえば、ユーザーが Web サイトにログインする際に、それが統合されているすべてのダウンストリームサービスへのリクエストを生成する場合、それらを単一のスパンとして表示できます。 ヒント OTel はアプリケーショントレースに限定されず、ログやメトリクスにも広く使用されています。また、多くの ISV 製品が現在 OTLP を直接受け入れています。 備考 OTel を使用してアプリケーションを計装することで、将来別のオブザーバビリティプラットフォームに移行する場合でも、アプリケーション層での計装を置き換える必要がなくなります。これにより、オブザーバビリティソリューションの一部が Two-way Door となります。 備考 OTel は将来性があり、スケーラブルで、アプリケーションコードを変更することなく収集および分析システムを将来変更することを容易にします。これにより効率的な シフトレフト が可能になります。 このページを編集 前へ AWS Lambda ベースのサーバーレスオブザーバビリティと OpenTelemetry 次へ AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Collector

アプリケーションの計装 このページの見出し Java Spring Integration アプリケーションの計装 この記事では、Spring-Integration アプリケーションを Open Telemetry と X-ray を使用して手動で計装するアプローチについて説明します。 Spring-Integration フレームワークは、イベント駆動型アーキテクチャやメッセージング中心のアーキテクチャに典型的な統合ソリューションの開発を可能にするように設計されています。 一方、OpenTelemetry は、サービスが HTTP リクエストを使用して相互に通信および連携するマイクロサービスアーキテクチャに重点を置いています。 そのため、このガイドでは OpenTelemetry API を使用した手動計装により、Spring-Integration アプリケーションを計装する方法の例を提供します。 背景情報​ トレースとは何か？​ OpenTelemetry のドキュメント からの以下の引用は、トレースの目的について良い概要を示しています： 注記 トレースは、アプリケーションにリクエストが行われた際に何が起こるのかの全体像を示します。アプリケーションが単一のデータベースを持つモノリスであっても、洗練されたサービスメッシュであっても、トレースはアプリケーション内でリクエストが辿る完全な「パス」を理解する上で不可欠です。 トレースの主な利点の 1 つがリクエストのエンドツーエンドの可視性であることを考えると、リクエストの発信元からバックエンドまで、トレースを適切にリンクすることが重要です。 OpenTelemetry でこれを実現する一般的な方法は、ネストされたスパン を利用することです。 これは、スパンが最終目的地に到達するまでサービスからサービスへと受け渡されるマイクロサービスアーキテクチャで機能します。 Spring Integration アプリケーションでは、リモートとローカルの両方で作成されたスパン間に親子関係を作成する必要があります。 コンテキスト伝播を利用したトレーシング​ コンテキスト伝播を使用するアプローチをご紹介します。このアプローチは通常、ローカルおよびリモートで作成されたスパン間の親子関係を作成する必要がある場合に使用されますが、Spring Integration アプリケーションではコードを簡素化し、アプリケーションのスケーリングを可能にするために使用されます。複数のスレッドでメッセージを並列処理することが可能になり、異なるホストでメッセージを処理する必要がある場合は水平方向にスケールすることも可能になります。 これを実現するために必要な概要は以下の通りです： ChannelInterceptor を作成し、GlobalChannelInterceptor として登録して、すべてのチャネルで送信されるメッセージをキャプチャできるようにします。 ChannelInterceptor では以下を実装します： preSend メソッドで： アップストリームで生成された前のメッセージからコンテキストを読み取ろうとします。これにより、アップストリームメッセージからのスパンを接続できます。コンテキストが存在しない場合は、新しいトレースが開始されます（これは OpenTelemetry SDK によって実行されます）。 その操作を識別する一意の名前でスパンを作成します。これは、このメッセージが処理されているチャネルの名前にすることができます。 現在のコンテキストをメッセージに保存します。 コンテキストとスコープを thread.local に保存して、後で閉じることができるようにします。 ダウンストリームに送信されるメッセージにコンテキストを注入します。 afterSendCompletion で： thread.local からコンテキストとスコープを復元します。 コンテキストからスパンを再作成します。 メッセージの処理中に発生した例外を登録します。 スコープを閉じます。 スパンを終了します。 これは必要な作業の簡略化された説明です。Spring-Integration フレームワークを使用する機能的なサンプルアプリケーションを提供しています。このアプリケーションのコードはこちらで確認できます。 アプリケーションの計装に加えられた変更のみを確認するには、この差分をご覧ください。 このサンプルアプリケーションを実行するには以下を使用します:​ # ビルドと実行 mvn spring-boot:run # サンプル入力ファイルを作成してフローをトリガーする echo 'testcontent\\nline2content\\nlastline' > /tmp/in/testfile.txt このサンプルアプリケーションを試すには、アプリケーションと同じマシンで ADOT collector を実行する必要があります。以下のような設定を使用します： receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317

traces: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch/traces] exporters: [awsxray] metrics: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch/metrics] exporters: [awsemf] 結果​ サンプルアプリケーションを実行し、以下のコマンドを実行すると、次のような結果が得られます。 echo 'foo123\\nbar123\\nfoo1234' > /tmp/in/testfile.txt 上記のセグメントは、サンプルアプリケーションで説明されているワークフローと一致していることがわかります。 一部のメッセージの処理中に例外が発生することが想定されているため、それらが適切に記録され、X-Ray でトラブルシューティングができることがわかります。 よくある質問​ ネストされたスパンはどのように作成するのですか？​ OpenTelemetry には、スパンを接続するために使用できる 3 つのメカニズムがあります： 明示的な方法​ 子スパンを作成する場所に親スパンを渡し、以下のように両者をリンクする必要があります： Span childSpan = tracer.spanBuilder(\"child\") .setParent(Context.current().with(parentSpan)) .startSpan(); 暗黙的な方法​ スパンコンテキストは内部的に thread.local に保存されます。 この方法は、同一スレッド内でスパンを作成することが確実な場合に適しています。 void parentTwo() { Span parentSpan = tracer.spanBuilder(\"parent\").startSpan(); try(Scope scope = parentSpan.makeCurrent()) { childTwo(); } finally { parentSpan.end(); } } void childTwo() { Span childSpan = tracer.spanBuilder(\"child\") // NOTE: setParent(...) is not required; // `Span.current()` is automatically added as the parent .startSpan(); try(Scope scope = childSpan.makeCurrent()) { // do stuff } finally { childSpan.end(); } } コンテキストの伝播​ このメソッドは、子スパンが作成されるリモートロケーションに転送できるように、コンテキストを特定の場所 (HTTP ヘッダーやメッセージ内) に保存します。 リモートロケーションである必要は必ずしもありません。 同一プロセス内でも使用できます。 OpenTelemetry のプロパティは X-Ray のプロパティにどのように変換されますか？​ ガイド

(ADOT) Collector の運用 このページの見出し AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Collector の運用 ADOT collector は、CNCF による OpenTelemetry Collector のダウンストリームディストリビューションです。 お客様は ADOT Collector を使用して、オンプレミス、AWS、その他のクラウドプロバイダーなど、さまざまな環境からメトリクスやトレースなどのシグナルを収集できます。 実際の環境で ADOT Collector を大規模に運用するためには、オペレーターは Collector の健全性を監視し、必要に応じてスケールする必要があります。このガイドでは、本番環境で ADOT Collector を運用するために取るべきアクションについて学びます。 デプロイメントアーキテクチャ​ 要件に応じて、検討すべきデプロイメントオプションがいくつかあります。 コレクターなし エージェント ゲートウェイ ヒント これらの概念の詳細については、OpenTelemetry のドキュメントを参照してください。 コレクターなし​ このオプションは、コレクターを完全に除外します。ご存知かもしれませんが、OTEL SDK から宛先サービスに直接 API 呼び出しを行い、シグナルを送信することが可能です。 例えば、ADOT Collector のようなプロセス外エージェントにスパンを送信する代わりに、アプリケーションプロセスから直接 AWS X-Ray の PutTraceSegments API を呼び出すことを考えてみてください。 このアプローチに関するガイダンスは AWS 固有の側面がないため、より詳細な情報については、アップストリームのドキュメントのセクションを参照することを強くお勧めします。 エージェント​ このアプローチでは、コレクターを分散方式で実行し、シグナルを各送信先に収集します。No Collector オプションとは異なり、ここでは関心を分離し、アプリケーションがリモート API コールにリソースを使用する必要性を切り離し、代わりにローカルでアクセス可能なエージェントと通信します。 基本的に、Amazon EKS 環境では、以下のように コレクターを Kubernetes のサイドカーとして実行します： 上記のアーキテクチャでは、コレクターがアプリケーションコンテナと同じ Pod で実行されているため、localhost からターゲットをスクレイピングすることになり、サービスディスカバリーメカニズムを使用する必要はありません。 同じアーキテクチャはトレースの収集にも適用されます。ここに示すように、OTEL パイプラインを作成するだけです。 メリットとデメリット​ この設計を支持する 1 つの論点は、ターゲットが localhost のソースに限定されているため、Collector が処理を行うために特別な量のリソース (CPU、メモリ) を割り当てる必要がないことです。 このアプローチを使用する際のデメリットは、Collector Pod の設定のバリエーション数が、クラスター上で実行しているアプリケーションの数に比例することです。 つまり、Pod の予想されるワークロードに応じて、CPU、メモリ、その他のリソース割り当てを Pod ごとに個別に管理する必要があります。 これを慎重に行わないと、Collector Pod に対するリソースの過剰割り当てや過少割り当てが発生し、パフォーマンスの低下や、他の Pod が使用できるはずの CPU サイクルとメモリの占有につながる可能性があります。 また、ニーズに応じて Deployments、Daemonset、Statefulset などの他のモデルで Collector をデプロイすることもできます。 Amazon EKS での Daemonset としてのコレクターの実行​ コレクターの負荷（メトリクスのスクレイピングと Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus ワークスペースへの送信）を EKS ノード全体に均等に分散させたい場合は、コレクターを Daemonset として実行することができます。 コレクターが自身のホスト/ノードからのみターゲットをスクレイプするように、keep アクションが設定されていることを確認してください。 参考として、以下にサンプルを示します。より詳細な設定についてはこちらをご覧ください。 scrape_configs: - job_name: kubernetes-apiservers bearer_token_file: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token kubernetes_sd_configs: - role: endpoints relabel_configs: - action: keep regex: $K8S_NODE_NAME source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_endpoint_node_name] scheme: https tls_config: ca_file: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt insecure_skip_verify: true 同じアーキテクチャはトレースの収集にも使用できます。この場合、コレクターが Prometheus メトリクスをスクレイプするためにエンドポイントにアクセスする代わりに、トレースのスパンはアプリケーション Pod からコレクターに送信されます。 メリットとデメリット​ 利点 スケーリングの懸念が最小限 高可用性の設定が課題 使用される Collector のコピーが多すぎる ログのサポートが容易 欠点 リソース使用の観点から最適ではない リソース割り当てが不均衡 Amazon EC2 でのコレクターの実行​ EC2 でコレクターを実行する場合、サイドカーアプローチはないため、EC2 インスタンス上でエージェントとしてコレクターを実行することになります。以下のような静的なスクレイプ設定を行うことで、インスタンス内のメトリクスを収集するターゲットを検出できます。 以下の設定は、localhost 上のポート 9090 と 8081 のエンドポイントをスクレイプします。 One Observability Workshop の EC2 に焦点を当てたモジュール で、このトピックについてのハンズオンの詳細な体験ができます。 global: scrape_interval: 15s # By default, scrape targets every 15 seconds. scrape_configs: - job_name: 'prometheus' static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9090', 'localhost:8081'] Amazon EKS でコレクターを Deployment として実行する​ コレクターを Deployment として実行することは、コレクターの高可用性を確保したい場合に特に有用です。 ターゲットの数、スクレイプ可能なメトリクスなどに応じて、コレクターのリソースを適切に調整する必要があります。 これにより、コレクターのリソース不足を防ぎ、シグナル収集の問題を回避できます。 このトピックの詳細については、こちらのガイドをご覧ください。 以下のアーキテクチャは、メトリクスとトレースを収集するために、ワークロードノードとは別のノードにコレクターをデプロイする方法を示しています。 メトリクス収集の高可用性を設定するには、詳細な手順を提供するドキュメントをご覧ください Amazon ECS でメトリクス収集のためにコレクターを中央タスクとして実行する​ ECS Observer 拡張機能 を使用して、ECS クラスター内または複数のクラスター間で異なるタスクの Prometheus メトリクスを収集できます。 拡張機能のサンプルコレクター設定: extensions:

このモデルの利点は、自身で管理するコレクターと設定が少なくて済むことです。 クラスターが大規模で、スクレイピング対象が数千に及ぶ場合、負荷がコレクター間で均等に分散されるようにアーキテクチャを慎重に設計する必要があります。高可用性のために同じコレクターのクローンを実行する必要があることも考慮すると、運用上の問題を避けるために慎重な検討が必要です。 Gateway​ コレクターの健全性管理​ OTEL コレクターは、その健全性とパフォーマンスを監視するための複数のシグナルを公開しています。以下のような是正措置を講じるために、コレクターの健全性を綿密に監視することが重要です。 コレクターの水平スケーリング コレクターが期待通りに機能するための追加リソースのプロビジョニング Collector からのヘルスメトリクスの収集​ OTEL Collector は、service パイプラインに

上記のサンプル出力では、コレクターが otelcol_exporter_enqueue_failed_spans というメトリクスを公開しており、送信キューに追加できなかったスパンの数を示していることがわかります。 このメトリクスは、コレクターが設定された送信先にトレースデータを送信する際に問題が発生していないかを理解するために監視すべきものです。 この場合、使用中のトレース送信先を示す exporter ラベルの値が awsxray であることがわかります。 もう 1 つのメトリクス otelcol_process_runtime_total_sys_memory_bytes は、コレクターが使用しているメモリ量を理解するための指標です。 このメモリが otelcol_process_memory_rss メトリクスの値に近づきすぎると、コレクターがプロセスに割り当てられたメモリを使い果たしそうであることを示しています。 その場合、問題を回避するためにコレクターにより多くのメモリを割り当てるなどの対策を講じる時期かもしれません。 同様に、otelcol_exporter_enqueue_failed_metric_points という別のカウンターメトリクスがあり、リモート送信先への送信に失敗したメトリクスの数を示しています。 コレクターのヘルスチェック​ コレクターは、稼働状態を確認するためのリブネスプローブを公開しています。このエンドポイントを使用して、定期的にコレクターの可用性を確認することをお勧めします。 healthcheck 拡張機能を使用して、コレクターにエンドポイントを公開させることができます。以下に設定例を示します： extensions: health_check: endpoint: 0.0.0.0:13133 完全な設定オプションについては、GitHub リポジトリ を参照してください。 ❯ curl -v http://localhost:13133 * Trying 127.0.0.1:13133...

これは特に、Prometheus メトリクスを収集するために ADOT Collector を運用する場合に重要です。 次のようなシナリオを考えてみましょう。あなたは DevOps チームに所属し、Amazon EKS クラスターでの ADOT Collector のデプロイと運用を担当しています。アプリケーションチームは、1 日のいつでも自由にアプリケーション Pod をデプロイでき、それらの Pod から公開されるメトリクスが Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus ワークスペースに収集されることを期待しています。 このパイプラインを問題なく機能させることは、あなたの責任です。この問題を解決するには、大きく分けて 2 つの方法があります： コレクターを無限にスケーリング（必要に応じてクラスターにノードを追加）して、この要件をサポートする メトリクス収集に制限を設定し、アプリケーションチームに上限を通知する 両方のアプローチにはそれぞれメリットとデメリットがあります。コストやオーバーヘッドを考慮せずに、成長し続けるビジネスニーズを完全にサポートすることを約束するのであれば、オプション 1 を選択することもできます。「クラウドは無限のスケーラビリティのためにある」という観点から、無限に成長するビジネスニーズをサポートすることは魅力的に聞こえるかもしれません。しかし、これは多くの運用上のオーバーヘッドをもたらし、無限の時間とリソース、継続的な中断のない運用を確保するための人材がない場合、より致命的な状況につながる可能性があります。これは多くの場合、現実的ではありません。 より実用的で賢明なアプローチは、オプション 2 を選択することです。これは、運用の境界を明確にするために、任意の時点で上限を設定し（必要に応じて段階的に増やすことも可能）、運用の境界を明確にする方法です。 以下は、ADOT Collector で Prometheus レシーバーを使用してこれを実現する方法の例です。 Prometheus の scrape_config では、特定のスクレイプジョブに対していくつかの制限を設定できます。以下のような制限を設定できます： スクレイプの総ボディサイズ 受け入れるラベルの数を制限（この制限を超えるとスクレイプは破棄され、Collector のログで確認できます） スクレイプするターゲットの数を制限 その他 利用可能なすべてのオプションは Prometheus のドキュメント で確認できます。 メモリ使用量の制限​ Collector パイプラインは memorylimiterprocessor を使用するように設定でき、プロセッサコンポーネントが使用するメモリ量を制限できます。 お客様が、大量のメモリと CPU リソースを必要とする複雑な操作を Collector に実行させたいと考えることは一般的です。 redactionprocessor、filterprocessor、spanprocessor などのプロセッサの使用は魅力的で非常に便利ですが、プロセッサは一般的にデータ変換タスクを処理し、タスクを完了するためにデータをメモリ内に保持する必要があることも覚えておく必要があります。 これにより、特定のプロセッサが Collector 全体を破壊したり、Collector が独自のヘルスメトリクスを公開するのに十分なメモリを持てなくなったりする可能性があります。 memorylimiterprocessor を使用することで、Collector が使用できるメモリ量を制限できます。 推奨される方法は、プロセッサが割り当てられたメモリをすべて使用しないように、ヘルスメトリクスの公開やその他のタスクを実行するためのバッファメモリを Collector に提供することです。 例えば、EKS Pod のメモリ制限が 10Gi の場合、memorylimitprocessor を 10Gi 未満（例えば 9Gi）に設定することで、1Gi のバッファをヘルスメトリクスの公開、レシーバー、エクスポーターのタスクなどの他の操作に使用できます。 バックプレッシャー管理​ 以下に示すようなアーキテクチャパターン (Gateway パターン) は、コンプライアンス要件を維持するためにシグナルデータから機密データをフィルタリングするなどの運用タスクを一元化するために使用できます。 しかし、Gateway Collector に多くの 処理 タスクを集中させすぎると問題が発生する可能性があります。推奨されるアプローチは、プロセスやメモリを多く使用するタスクを個々のコレクターとゲートウェイの間で分散し、ワークロードを共有することです。 例えば、resourceprocessor を使用してリソース属性を処理し、transformprocessor を使用してシグナルの収集時に個々のコレクター内でシグナルデータを変換することができます。 その後、filterprocessor を使用してシグナルデータの特定の部分をフィルタリングし、redactionprocessor を使用してクレジットカード番号などの機密情報を編集することができます。 高レベルのアーキテクチャ図は以下のようになります： すでにお気づきかもしれませんが、Gateway Collector はすぐにシングルポイントオブフェイラーになる可能性があります。明確な選択肢の 1 つは、以下に示すように複数の Gateway Collector を起動し、AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) などのロードバランサーを通じてリクエストをプロキシすることです。 Prometheus メトリクス収集における順序外サンプルの処理​ 以下のアーキテクチャにおけるシナリオを考えてみましょう： Amazon EKS クラスター内の ADOT Collector-1 からのメトリクスが、Gateway ADOT Collector-1 に向けられているゲートウェイクラスターに送信されると仮定します。 しばらくすると、同じ ADOT Collector-1 からのメトリクス（同じターゲットを収集しているため、同じメトリクスサンプルが扱われています）が Gateway ADOT Collector-2 に送信されます。 ここで、Gateway ADOT Collector-2 が先に Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus ワークスペースにメトリクスを送信し、その後で同じメトリクスシリーズの古いサンプルを含む Gateway ADOT Collector-1 が送信した場合、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus から out of order sample エラーが返されます。 以下にエラーの例を示します： Error message:

アドレスに基づいて、特定のソースからのリクエストを同じターゲットに転送するスティッキーロードバランサーを使用します。 詳細については、こちらのリンクを参照してください。 代替オプションとして、Gateway Collectors に外部ラベルを追加して、メトリクスシリーズを区別することができます。これにより、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus はこれらのメトリクスを個別のメトリクスシリーズとして扱い、同一のものとは見なしません。 警告 このソリューションを使用すると、Gateway Collectors の数に比例してメトリクスシリーズが増加します。これは、アクティブな時系列の制限 などの制限を超える可能性があることを意味します。 ADOT Collector を Daemonset としてデプロイする場合：relabel_configs を使用して、各 ADOT Collector Pod が実行されている同じノードからのサンプルのみを保持するようにしてください。詳細については、以下のリンクを参照してください。 Amazon Managed Prometheus の高度なコレクター設定 - Click to View セクションを展開し、以下のような項目を確認してください： relabel_configs: - action: keep regex: $K8S_NODE_NAME ADOT Add-On の高度な設定 - ADOT Add-On for EKS の高度な設定を使用して ADOT Collector をデプロイする方法を学びます。 ADOT Collector のデプロイ戦略 - スケールでの ADOT Collector のデプロイの異なる選択肢と、各アプローチの利点について学びます。 Open Agent Management Protocol (OpAMP)​ OpAMP は、HTTP および WebSocket を介した通信をサポートするクライアント/サーバープロトコルです。 OpAMP は OTel Collector に実装されており、OTel Collector 自体のような OpAMP をサポートする他のエージェントを管理するためのコントロールプレーンの一部として、サーバーとして使用できます。 ここでの「管理」とは、Collector の設定の更新、ヘルスモニタリング、さらには Collector のアップグレードを行うことができることを意味します。 このプロトコルの詳細は、OpenTelemetry の公式ウェブサイトに詳しく記載されています。 水平スケーリング​ ワークロードに応じて、ADOT Collector を水平方向にスケーリングする必要が生じる場合があります。 水平スケーリングの要件は、ユースケース、Collector の設定、テレメトリのスループットによって異なります。 プラットフォーム固有の水平スケーリング技術は、ステートフル、ステートレス、スクレイパーの Collector コンポーネントを意識しながら、他のアプリケーションと同様に Collector に適用できます。 ほとんどの Collector コンポーネントは stateless で、メモリ内に状態を保持せず、保持している場合でもスケーリングの目的には関係ありません。 ステートレスな Collector の追加レプリカは、アプリケーションロードバランサーの背後でスケーリングできます。 Stateful な Collector コンポーネントは、そのコンポーネントの動作に重要なメモリ内の情報を保持するコンポーネントです。 ADOT Collector のステートフルなコンポーネントの例には、以下のようなものがありますが、これらに限定されません： Tail Sampling Processor - 正確なサンプリングの判断を行うために、トレースのすべてのスパンが必要です。高度なサンプリングスケーリング技術は ADOT 開発者ポータルに記載されています。 AWS EMF Exporter - 一部のメトリクスタイプで累積値からデルタ値への変換を実行します。この変換には、前回のメトリクス値をメモリに保存する必要があります。 Cummulative to Delta Processor - 累積値からデルタ値への変換には、前回のメトリクス値をメモリに保存する必要があります。 scrapers である Collector コンポーネントは、テレメトリデータを受動的に受け取るのではなく、能動的に取得します。 現在、Prometheus receiver は ADOT Collector で唯一のスクレイパータイプのコンポーネントです。 Prometheus receiver を含む Collector 設定を水平方向にスケーリングする場合は、2 つの Collector が同じエンドポイントをスクレイプしないように、Collector ごとにスクレイピングジョブを分割する必要があります。 これを行わないと、Prometheus のサンプル順序エラーが発生する可能性があります。 Collector のスケーリングのプロセスと技術については、上流の OpenTelemetry ウェブサイトでより詳しく説明されています。 このページを編集 前へ

はじめに​ オブザーバビリティの本質は、システムの外部出力を分析することで、システムの内部状態を理解し、洞察を得る能力です。 この概念は、事前に定義されたメトリクスやイベントに焦点を当てた従来の監視アプローチから、環境内のさまざまなコンポーネントが生成するデータの収集、分析、可視化を包括する、より総合的なアプローチへと進化してきました。 システムは観察されなければ、制御も最適化もできません。 効果的なオブザーバビリティ戦略により、チームは問題を素早く特定して解決し、リソースの使用を最適化し、システム全体の健全性に関する洞察を得ることができます。 オブザーバビリティは、問題を効率的に検出、調査、修復する能力を提供し、ワークロードの全体的な運用可用性と健全性を向上させることができます。 モニタリングとオブザーバビリティの違いは、モニタリングがシステムが機能しているかどうかを示すのに対し、オブザーバビリティはシステムが機能していない理由を示すことです。 モニタリングは通常、事後対応的な手段ですが、オブザーバビリティの目標は、主要業績評価指標 (KPI) を事前対応的に改善できるようにすることです。 継続的なモニタリングとオブザーバビリティは、クラウド環境におけるアジリティの向上、カスタマーエクスペリエンスの改善、リスクの低減を実現します。 オブザーバビリティ成熟度モデル​ オブザーバビリティ成熟度モデルは、ワークロードのオブザーバビリティと管理プロセスの最適化を目指す組織にとって、重要なフレームワークとして機能します。 このモデルは、企業が現在の能力を評価し、改善が必要な領域を特定し、最適なオブザーバビリティを実現するために適切なツールとプロセスに戦略的に投資するための包括的なロードマップを提供します。 クラウドコンピューティング、マイクロサービス、エフェメラルおよび分散システムの時代において、オブザーバビリティはデジタルサービスの信頼性とパフォーマンスを確保する重要な要素となっています。 このモデルはオブザーバビリティを改善するための構造化されたアプローチを提供することで、組織がシステムをより深く理解し制御することを可能にし、より回復力があり、効率的で、高性能なビジネスへの道を開きます。 オブザーバビリティ成熟度モデルのステージ​ 組織がワークロードを拡大するにつれて、オブザーバビリティ成熟度モデルも成熟することが期待されます。 しかし、オブザーバビリティの成熟度は必ずしもワークロードと共に成長するわけではありません。 目的は、組織の能力が拡大・成長するにつれて、必要な成熟度レベルを達成できるよう支援することです。 オブザーバビリティ成熟度モデルの最初のステージでは、通常、組織の現状を把握するためのベースラインを確立します。 これには、既存のモニタリングツールとプロセスの評価、および可視性や機能性のギャップの特定が含まれます。 このステージでは、組織は現在の能力を把握し、エンジニアリングサイクルの初期段階から現実的な改善目標を設定することができます。 次のステージでは、組織はより高度なオブザーバビリティ戦略とサービスを採用することで、より洗練されたアプローチに移行します。 これには、プロアクティブなアラート、異なるシステム間の相互作用を把握するための分散トレーシングの実装が含まれ、これにより組織は可視性の向上、認知負荷の軽減、より効率的なトラブルシューティングの利点を享受し始めることができます。 オブザーバビリティ成熟度モデルの第 3 段階では、自動修復、人工知能、機械学習技術を活用して、異常検出とルート原因分析を自動化することができます。 これらの高度な機能により、組織は問題を検出するだけでなく、エンドユーザーに影響を与えたり、業務を中断したりする前に是正措置を講じることができます。 オブザーバビリティツールをインシデント管理プラットフォームなどの重要なシステムと統合することで、組織はインシデント対応プロセスを効率化し、問題解決にかかる時間を最小限に抑えることができます。 オブザーバビリティ成熟度モデルの最終段階では、モニタリングとオブザーバビリティツールによって生成された豊富なデータを活用して、継続的な改善を推進します。 これには、高度な分析を使用してワークロードのパフォーマンスのパターンやトレンドを特定し、この情報をエンジニアリングと運用プロセスにフィードバックして、リソースの割り当て、アーキテクチャ、デプロイメント戦略を最適化することが含まれます。 ステージ 1: 基礎的なモニタリング - テレメトリーデータの収集​ 最低限必要なものとして採用され、サイロ化して運用される基礎的なモニタリングでは、組織内のシステムやワークロード全体を監視するために必要な明確な戦略が定義されていません。 多くの場合、アプリケーション所有者、ネットワークオペレーションセンター (NOC)、CloudOps、DevOps などの異なるチームが、それぞれのモニタリングニーズに応じて異なるツールを使用するため、環境全体のデバッグや最適化の観点からはあまり価値がありません。 通常、このステージのお客様は、ワークロードの監視に異なるソリューションを使用しています。 異なるチームは、他のチームとの連携が限られているか、まったくないため、同じデータを異なる方法で収集することが多くなります。 チームは、自分たちが取得したデータを使用して必要なものを最適化する傾向があります。 また、他のチームから取得したデータが異なる形式である可能性があるため、チーム間でデータを共有することができません。 重要なワークロードを特定するための計画を作成し、オブザーバビリティの統一されたソリューションを目指し、メトリクスとログを定義することが、このレベルでの重要な側面となります。 ワークロードの内部状態とワークロードの健全性を理解するためには、ワークロードが提供する重要なテレメトリーを取得できるように設計することが必要です。 成熟度レベルを向上させるための基盤を構築するために、メトリクス、ログ、トレースの収集を通じてワークロードを計測し、適切なモニタリングとオブザーバビリティツールを使用して意味のある洞察を得ることで、お客様は環境を制御および最適化することができます。 計測とは、ワークロードの動作とパフォーマンスを観察するために使用できる重要なデータを環境から測定、追跡、取得することを指します。 例としては、エラー、成功または失敗したトランザクションなどのアプリケーションメトリクス、CPU やディスクリソースの使用率などのインフラストラクチャメトリクスがあります。 ステージ 2：中級モニタリング - テレメトリー分析とインサイト​ このステージでは、オンプレミスやクラウドなど、様々な環境からのシグナル収集に関して、組織の理解が深まっています。 オブザーバビリティの基本構造となるメトリクス、ログ、トレースをワークロードから収集する仕組みを考案し、可視化、アラート戦略を作成し、明確な基準に基づいて問題の優先順位付けを行う能力も備えています。 推測による対応的な対処ではなく、必要なアクションを呼び出すワークフローを持ち、関連チームが収集された情報と過去の知見に基づいて分析とトラブルシューティングを行うことができます。 このレベルの顧客は、従来型であれ最新型であれ、高度にスケーラブルで分散化された、アジャイルでマイクロサービスアーキテクチャの環境に対するオブザーバビリティのプラクティスの達成に向けて取り組んでいます。 ほとんどの場合、モニタリングは上手く機能しているように見えますが、組織は問題のデバッグにより多くの時間を費やす傾向があり、その結果、全体的な平均解決時間 (MTTR) は一定期間にわたって一貫性がなく、意味のある改善も見られません。 また、問題のデバッグに予想以上の認知的な時間と労力がかかるため、インシデント対応が長引きます。 さらに、運用を圧迫するデータ過負荷の状況も発生しがちです。 多くの企業は、次のステップが見えないまま、このステージで足踏みしている状態にあります。 組織を次のレベルに進めるために取れる具体的なアクションは以下の通りです：1) システムのアーキテクチャ設計を定期的にレビューし、影響とダウンタイムを減らしアラートを少なくするためのポリシーとプラクティスを導入する。2) アクション可能な KPI を定義し、アラートの発見事項に価値のあるコンテキストを追加し、重要度/緊急度で分類し、異なるツールやチームに送信することで、エンジニアが問題をより迅速に解決できるようにしてアラート疲れを防ぐ。 これらのアラートを定期的に分析し、頻繁に発生する一般的なアラートに対する修復を自動化します。 アラートの発見事項を関連チームと共有・伝達し、運用とプロセスの改善に関するフィードバックを提供します。 異なるエンティティを相関付け、システムの異なる部分間の依存関係を理解するのに役立つナレッジグラフを段階的に構築する計画を立てます。 これにより、顧客はシステムへの変更の影響を可視化し、潜在的な問題を予測して軽減することができます。 ステージ 3：高度なオブザーバビリティ - 相関関係と異常検知​ このステージでは、組織は多くの時間をトラブルシューティングに費やすことなく、問題の根本原因を明確に理解できるようになります。 問題が発生した場合、アラートは Network Operations Center (NOC)、CloudOps、DevOps チームなどの関連チームに十分なコンテキスト情報を提供します。 モニタリングチームは、アラートを確認し、メトリクス、ログ、トレースなどのシグナルの相関関係を通じて、問題の根本原因をすぐに特定できます。 トレースは、アプリケーションからリクエストに関して収集されたデータで、問題の特定や最適化の機会を見つけるために、ツールを使用して表示、フィルタリング、洞察を得ることができます。 アプリケーションのトレースリクエストは、リクエストとレスポンスに関する詳細情報だけでなく、アプリケーションが下流の AWS リソース、マイクロサービス、データベース、Web API に対して行う呼び出しに関する情報も提供します。 トレースを確認し、トレースがキャプチャされた対応するログイベントを見つけ、インフラストラクチャとアプリケーションからのメトリクスを確認することで、状況の 360° ビューを得ることができます。 適切なチームは、問題を解決する修正を提供することですぐに是正措置を取ることができます。 このシナリオでは、MTTR は非常に小さく、Service Level Objectives (SLO) は緑色で、エラーバジェットの消費率は許容範囲内です。 通常、このレベルのお客様は、モダンで俊敏性が高く、高度にスケーラブルなマイクロサービス環境のオブザーバビリティに関するプラクティスを達成しています。 多くの組織が、オブザーバビリティ環境においてこのレベルの洗練度と成熟度を達成しています。 このステージでは、組織は複雑なインフラストラクチャをサポートし、高可用性でシステムを運用し、アプリケーションに対してより高い Service Level Availability (SLA) を提供し、信頼性の高いインフラストラクチャを提供することでビジネスイノベーションを達成する能力を既に持っています。 お客様は、通常のパターンに一致しない異常値や外れ値を監視し、ほぼリアルタイムのアラート機能を持つ異常検知も使用しています。 しかし、このような組織のチームは常に可能性の限界を超えようとしています。 チームは、繰り返し発生する問題を理解し、将来発生する可能性のある問題を予測するためのシナリオに対してモデル化できる知識ベースを作成したいと考えています。 これが、お客様が成熟度モデルの次のステージに移行する時期であり、未知の領域への洞察を得ることができます。 そこに到達するためには、新しいツールが必要であり、また、データの保存と活用に関する新しいスキルと技術を特定する必要があります。 過去に収集したデータを使用して学習したモデルに基づいて、シグナルを自動的に相関付け、根本原因を特定し、解決計画を作成するシステムを構築するために、IT 運用のための人工知能 (AIOps) を活用することができます。 ステージ 4：プロアクティブなオブザーバビリティ - 自動的かつ事前の根本原因特定​ ここでは、オブザーバビリティのデータは問題が発生した「後」だけでなく、問題が発生する「前」にリアルタイムでデータを活用します。 十分に学習されたモデルを使用することで、問題を事前に特定し、より簡単に解決することができます。 収集されたシグナルを分析することで、モニタリングシステムは問題に関する洞察を自動的に提供し、解決のためのオプションを提示することができます。 オブザーバビリティソフトウェアベンダーは、この分野での機能を継続的に拡大しており、生成 AI の普及によってさらに加速しています。 そのため、このような成熟度レベルを目指す組織は容易に達成することができます。 このステージが成熟し形を整えると、オブザーバビリティサービスが自動的に動的なダッシュボードを作成できるようになります。 ダッシュボードには、当面の問題に関連する情報のみを含めることができます。 これにより、実際には重要でないデータのクエリと可視化にかかる時間とコストを節約できます。 生成 AI (GenAI) と機械学習を実行するためのコンピューティングが日々民主化されることで、将来的にはプロアクティブなモニタリング機能が現在よりも一般的になる可能性があります。 AWS ネイティブおよびオープンソースのソリューションによるデータ収集、データ処理、データの洞察と分析のための包括的なオブザーバビリティポートフォリオの概要を示します。 これにより、お客様は自身のエンドツーエンドのオブザーバビリティニーズに適したソリューションを選択することができます。 オブザーバビリティのための AWS Well-Architected と Cloud Adoption Framework​ 組織は AWS Well-Architected と Cloud Adoption Framework を活用して、オブザーバビリティ機能を強化し、クラウド環境を効果的に監視およびトラブルシューティングすることができます。 オブザーバビリティのための AWS Well-Architected と Cloud Adoption Framework は、ワークロードの設計、デプロイ、運用のための構造化されたアプローチを提供し、ベストプラクティスの遵守を確実にします。 これにより、可用性、システムパフォーマンス、スケーラビリティ、信頼性が向上します。 また、これらのフレームワークは、組織に標準化された一連のプラクティスと規範的なガイダンスを提供し、組織全体でのコラボレーション、知識の共有、一貫したソリューションの実装を容易にします。 効果的に活用するために、組織は AWS Well-Architected フレームワークの主要なコンポーネントである柱（オペレーショナルエクセレンス、セキュリティ、信頼性、パフォーマンス効率、コスト最適化、持続可能性）を理解する必要があります。 これらの柱は、クラウド環境の設計と運用のための包括的なアプローチを提供します。 一方、Cloud Adoption Framework は、ビジネス、人材、ガバナンス、プラットフォームなどの領域に焦点を当てた、クラウド導入のための構造化されたアプローチを提供します。 これらのコンポーネントをオブザーバビリティの要件と整合させることで、組織は堅牢でスケーラブルなワークロードを構築できます。 オブザーバビリティのための AWS Well-Architected と Cloud Adoption Framework の実装には、いくつかのステップが必要です。 まず、組織は現状を評価し、改善が必要な領域を特定する必要があります。 これは、ワークロードをこれらのフレームワークに照らして評価するオブザーバビリティ成熟度モデル評価を実施することで可能です。 レビュー結果に基づいて、組織はオブザーバビリティの取り組みの優先順位付けと計画を行うことができます。 これには、監視とロギングの要件の定義、適切な AWS サービスの選択、必要なインフラストラクチャとツールの実装が含まれます。 最後に、組織は継続的な有効性を確保するために、オブザーバビリティソリューションを継続的に監視し最適化する必要があります。 また、お客様は AWS のサービスである AWS Well-Architected Tool を使用して、AWS Well-Architected Framework のベストプラクティスを使用してワークロードを文書化し測定することができます。 このツールは、AWS Well-Architected Framework の柱を通じてワークロードを測定するための一貫したプロセスを提供し、お客様が行う決定の文書化を支援し、ワークロードを改善するための推奨事項を提供し、ワークロードをより信頼性が高く、安全で、効率的で、コスト効果の高いものにするためのガイダンスを提供します。 アセスメント​ オブザーバビリティ成熟度モデルのアセスメントは、現在のオブザーバビリティの状態を評価し、改善が必要な領域を特定するために使用できます。 各段階のアセスメントでは、異なるチーム間での既存の監視・管理プラクティスを評価し、ギャップと改善領域を特定し、次の段階への全体的な準備状況を判断することが不可欠です。 成熟度アセスメントは、ビジネスプロセスの概要、ワークロードのインベントリとツールの発見、現在の課題の特定、組織の優先事項と目標の理解から始まります。 このアセスメントは、既存のレイアウトのさらなる開発と最適化の基礎となる、対象となるメトリクスと KPI の特定に役立ちます。 オブザーバビリティ成熟度モデルのアセスメントは、ビジネスが現代のシステムの複雑で動的な性質に対処する準備ができていることを確認する上で重要な役割を果たします。 システム障害やパフォーマンスの問題につながる可能性のあるブラインドスポットや弱点の領域を特定するのに役立ちます。 さらに、定期的なアセスメントにより、ビジネスの俊敏性と適応性が維持されます。 進化するテクノロジーと方法論に遅れを取らないようにし、システムが常に最高の効率性と信頼性を維持できるようにします。 このアセスメントは、AWS のベストプラクティスに照らしてオブザーバビリティ戦略の状態を確認し、改善の機会を特定し、時間の経過とともに進捗を追跡するのに役立つように設計されています。 以下の質問は、現在のオブザーバビリティ成熟度レベルを評価するのに役立ちます。 無料で「AWS

SLO をどのように使用していますか？ オブザーバビリティ戦略の構築​ 組織がオブザーバビリティの段階を特定したら、現在のプロセスとツールを最適化するための戦略を構築し、成熟度向上に向けて取り組み始める必要があります。 組織は顧客に優れた体験を提供することを望んでいるため、まずそれらの顧客要件から始めて、そこから Working Backwards を行います。 そして、これらの要件を深く理解しているステークホルダーと協力します。 オブザーバビリティ戦略を目指すにあたり、組織はまず全体的なビジネス目標に沿ったオブザーバビリティの目標を定義する必要があります。 この目標は、戦略を通じて組織が達成しようとすることを明確に示し、オブザーバビリティ計画の構築と実装のためのロードマップを提供する必要があります。 次に、組織はシステムパフォーマンスの洞察を提供する重要なメトリクス (KPI) を特定する必要があります。 これらは、レイテンシーやエラー率から、リソース使用率やトランザクション量まで多岐にわたります。 メトリクスの選択は、ビジネスの性質と特定のニーズに大きく依存することに注意することが重要です。 重要なメトリクスを特定したら、組織はデータ収集に必要なツールとテクノロジーを決定できます。 ツールの選択は、組織の目標との整合性、既存システムとの統合の容易さ、コストの最適化、スケーラビリティの実現、顧客ニーズの充足、全体的な顧客体験の向上に基づいて行う必要があります。 最後に、組織はオブザーバビリティを重視する文化も促進する必要があります。 これには、チームメンバーにオブザーバビリティの重要性についてトレーニングを行い、システムパフォーマンスを積極的に監視するよう促し、継続的な学習と改善の文化を育むことが含まれます。 この戦略は、最高の顧客体験を実現するための収集、アクション、改善の継続的なプロセスの好循環を生み出します。 まとめると、オブザーバビリティ戦略を構築するには、以下の 3 つの主要な側面を考慮する必要があります：1) 何を収集する必要があるか 2) 観察が必要なすべてのシステムとワークロードは何か 3) 問題が発生した場合にどのように対応し、それらを修正するためにどのようなメカニズムを用意すべきか。 まとめ​ オブザーバビリティ成熟度モデルは、組織が現状を評価し、ワークロードとインフラストラクチャの動作を理解、分析、対応する能力を向上させる方法を探るためのロードマップとして機能します。 現在の能力を評価し、高度な監視手法を採用し、データ駆動型のインサイトを活用するための体系的なアプローチに従うことで、企業はより高度なオブザーバビリティを実現し、ワークロードとインフラストラクチャについてより適切な意思決定を行うことができます。 このモデルは、組織が異なる成熟度レベルを進み、最終的にプロアクティブなオブザーバビリティのメリットを十分に活用できる状態に到達するために必要な主要な機能と実践方法を概説しています。 参考リソース​ 効果的なオブザーバビリティ戦略の構築 - AWS re:Invent 2023 AWS オブザーバビリティのベストプラクティス オブザーバビリティとは何か、なぜ重要なのか？

Alert Manager このページの見出し Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus Alert Manager はじめに​ Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) は、「Recording rules」と「Alerting rules」という 2 種類のルールをサポートしています。これらのルールは既存の Prometheus サーバーからインポートでき、定期的に評価されます。 Alerting rules を使用すると、PromQL としきい値に基づいてアラート条件を定義できます。アラートルールの値がしきい値を超えると、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus の Alert manager に通知が送信されます。これは、スタンドアロンの Prometheus のアラートマネージャーと同様の機能を提供します。アラートは、Prometheus のアラートルールがアクティブになったときの結果です。 アラートルールファイル​ Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus のアラートルールは、スタンドアロンの Prometheus と同じ形式の YAML 形式のルールファイルで定義されます。 お客様は Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus ワークスペースに複数のルールファイルを持つことができます。 ワークスペースは、Prometheus メトリクスの保存とクエリに専用の論理的な空間です。 ルールファイルは通常、以下のフィールドを持ちます： groups: - name: rules: - alert: expr: for: labels: annotations: Groups: 一定の間隔で順次実行されるルールのコレクション Name: グループの名前 Rules: グループ内のルール Alert: アラートの名前 Expr: アラートをトリガーする式 For: アラートのステータスが発火状態に更新される前に、アラートの式が閾値を超えている必要がある最小期間 Labels: アラートに付加される追加のラベル Annotations: 説明やリンクなどのコンテキスト情報 以下はサンプルルールファイルの例です groups: - name: test rules: - record: metric:recording_rule expr: avg(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[5m])) - name: alert-test rules: - alert: metric:alerting_rule expr: avg(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[5m])) > 0 for: 2m Alert Manager 設定ファイル​ Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus の Alert Manager は、YAML 形式の設定ファイルを使用してアラート（受信サービス用）を設定します。これは、スタンドアロンの Prometheus のアラートマネージャー設定ファイルと同じ構造を持っています。設定ファイルには、アラートマネージャーとテンプレート用の 2 つの主要なセクションがあります。 template_files には、$value、$labels、$externalLabels、$externalURL 変数として公開されるアラートのアノテーションとラベルのテンプレートが含まれています。$labels 変数は、アラートインスタンスのラベルのキー/値ペアを保持します。設定された外部ラベルには $externalLabels 変数を通じてアクセスできます。$value 変数は、アラートインスタンスの評価された値を保持します。.Value、.Labels、.ExternalLabels、.ExternalURL には、それぞれアラート値、アラートラベル、グローバルに設定された外部ラベル、外部 URL（--web.external-url で設定）が含まれています。 alertmanager_config には、スタンドアロンの Prometheus のアラートマネージャー設定ファイルと同じ構造を使用するアラートマネージャーの設定が含まれています。 template_files と alertmanager_config の両方を含むサンプルのアラートマネージャー設定ファイルは以下のようになります。 template_files: default_template: | {{ define \"sns.default.subject\" }}[{{ .Status | toUpper }}{{ if eq .Status \"firing\" }}:{{ .Alerts.Firing | len }}{{ end }}]{{ end }} {{ define \"__alertmanager\" }}AlertManager{{ end }} {{ define \"__alertmanagerURL\" }}{{ .ExternalURL }}/#/alerts?receiver={{ .Receiver | urlquery }}{{ end }} alertmanager_config: |

key: severity value: SEV2 アラートの重要な側面​ Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus の Alert Manager 設定ファイル を作成する際に注意すべき 3 つの重要な側面があります。 グルーピング: 類似したアラートを 1 つの通知にまとめることができます。これは、障害や停止の Blast Radius が大きく、多くのシステムに影響を与え、複数のアラートが同時に発生する場合に役立ちます。また、カテゴリー（ノードアラート、Pod アラートなど）でグループ化するためにも使用できます。アラートマネージャー設定ファイルの route ブロックを使用して、このグルーピングを設定できます。 抑制: すでにアクティブで発生している類似のアラートのスパムを避けるために、特定の通知を抑制する方法です。inhibit_rules ブロックを使用して抑制ルールを記述できます。 サイレンシング: メンテナンスウィンドウや計画的な停止時など、指定した期間中アラートをミュートできます。受信したアラートは、サイレンシングする前に、すべての等価性または正規表現に一致するかどうかが確認されます。PutAlertManagerSilences API を使用してサイレンシングを作成できます。 Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) を通じたアラートのルーティング​ 現在、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus Alert Manager は Amazon SNS を唯一の Receiver としてサポートしています。alertmanager_config ブロックの重要なセクションは Receivers で、アラートを受信するための Amazon SNS の設定が可能です。以下のセクションは、Receivers ブロックのテンプレートとして使用できます。 - name: name_of_receiver sns_configs: - sigv4: region: <AWS_Region> topic_arn: <ARN_of_SNS_topic> subject: somesubject attributes: key: <somekey>

などが含まれます。 メール 通知が成功すると、Amazon SNS トピックを介して Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus Alert Manager からアラートの詳細を含むメールが送信されます。 Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus Alert Manager は、アラートを JSON 形式で送信できます。これにより、Amazon SNS から AWS Lambda やウェブフック受信エンドポイントでダウンストリーム処理が可能になります。 Webhook 既存の Amazon SNS トピックは、Webhook エンドポイントにメッセージを出力するように設定できます。Webhook は、イベント駆動型のトリガーに基づいてアプリケーション間で HTTP を介して交換される、シリアル化された JSON または XML 形式のメッセージです。これは、アラート、チケット発行、インシデント管理システムのために、既存の SIEM やコラボレーションツールと連携するために使用できます。 Slack お客様は、Slack のメールからチャンネルへの統合機能を利用できます。Slack はメールを受け取り、Slack チャンネルに転送することができます。または、Lambda 関数を使用して SNS 通知を Slack 用に書き換えることもできます。 PagerDuty alertmanager_config 定義の template_files ブロックで使用されるテンプレートをカスタマイズして、PagerDuty に Amazon SNS の宛先としてペイロードを送信できます。 追加参考資料: カスタム Alert Manager テンプレート アラートのステータス​ アラートルールは、設定されたしきい値を超えた場合に任意の通知サービスにアラートを送信するための、式に基づいたアラート条件を定義します。 以下にルールとその式の例を示します。 rules: - alert: metric:alerting_rule expr: avg(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[5m])) > 0 for: 2m アラート式が特定の時点で 1 つ以上のベクトル要素を生成する場合、そのアラートはアクティブとみなされます。 アラートは、アクティブ (保留中 | 発火中) または解決済みのステータスを取ります。 保留中: しきい値超過からの経過時間が記録間隔より短い場合 発火中: しきい値超過からの経過時間が記録間隔より長く、Alert Manager がアラートをルーティングしている場合 解決済み: しきい値を超過しなくなったため、アラートが発火していない状態 これは、awscurl コマンドを使用して ListAlerts API で Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus の Alert Manager エンドポイントにクエリを実行することで手動で確認できます。 以下にリクエストの例を示します。 awscurl https://aps-workspaces.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/workspaces/$WORKSPACE_ID/alertmanager/api/v2/alerts --service=\"aps\" -H \"Content-Type:

Service for Prometheus のアラートマネージャーのアラートを可視化できます。 Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus ワークスペースを使用して Prometheus メトリクスを収集しているお客様は、サービスに完全に管理されたアラートマネージャーとルーラー機能を利用して、アラートとレコーディングルールを設定できます。 この機能により、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus ワークスペースで設定されたすべてのアラートとレコーディングルールを可視化できます。 Prometheus アラートビューは、ワークスペース設定オプションタブで Grafana アラートのチェックボックスをオンにすることで、Amazon Managed Grafana (AMG) コンソールで表示できます。 有効にすると、以前 Grafana ダッシュボードで作成されたネイティブの Grafana アラートが、Grafana ワークスペースの新しいアラートページに移行されます。 参考: Announcing Prometheus Alert manager rules in Amazon Managed Grafana ベースラインモニタリングに推奨されるアラート​ アラートは、堅牢なモニタリングとオブザーバビリティのベストプラクティスにおける重要な側面です。 アラートメカニズムは、アラート疲れと重要なアラートの見落としの間でバランスを取る必要があります。 以下は、ワークロードの全体的な信頼性を向上させるために推奨されるアラートの一部です。 組織内の各チームは、異なる視点からインフラストラクチャとワークロードのモニタリングを行っているため、要件とシナリオに応じてこれらを拡張または変更することができます。なお、これは包括的なリストではありません。 コンテナノードが割り当てられたメモリ制限の一定量（例：80%）以上を使用している場合 コンテナノードが割り当てられた CPU 制限の一定量（例：80%）以上を使用している場合 コンテナノードが割り当てられたディスク容量の一定量（例：90%）以上を使用している場合 名前空間内の Pod のコンテナが割り当てられた CPU 制限の一定量（例：80%）以上を使用している場合 名前空間内の Pod のコンテナが割り当てられたメモリ制限の一定量（例：80%）以上を使用している場合 名前空間内の Pod のコンテナの再起動回数が多すぎる場合 名前空間内の永続ボリュームがディスク容量の一定量（最大 75%）以上を使用している場合 デプロイメントに現在アクティブな Pod が実行されていない場合 名前空間内の Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) が最大容量で実行されている場合 上記またはその他の同様のシナリオに対してアラートを設定する際の重要なポイントは、必要に応じて式を変更することです。例えば、 expr: | ((sum(irate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{image!=\"\",container!=\"POD\", namespace!=\"kube-sys\"}[30s])) by (namespace,container,pod) / sum(container_spec_cpu_quota{image!=\"\",container!=\"POD\", namespace!=\"kube-sys\"} / container_spec_cpu_period{image!=\"\",container!=\"POD\", namespace!=\"kube-sys\"}) by (namespace,container,pod) ) * 100) > 80 for: 5m Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus 用 ACK コントローラー​ Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus の AWS Controller for Kubernetes (ACK) コントローラーは、Workspace、Alert Manager、Ruler リソースで利用可能です。これにより、お客様は Kubernetes クラスター外でリソースを定義することなく、カスタムリソース定義 (CRD) とネイティブオブジェクトまたはサービスを使用して Prometheus を活用できます。Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus 用 ACK コントローラー を使用すると、監視対象の Kubernetes クラスターから直接すべてのリソースを管理でき、ワークロードの望ましい状態に対して Kubernetes を「信頼できる情報源」として機能させることができます。ACK は、Kubernetes API を拡張し AWS リソースを管理するための Kubernetes CRD とカスタムコントローラーのコレクションです。 以下は、ACK を使用して設定されたアラートルールのスニペットです：

description: \"CPU load is < 30%\\n VALUE = {{ $value }}\\n LABELS = {{ $labels }}\" IAM ポリシーを使用したルールへのアクセス制限​ 組織では、各チームが独自のルールを作成し、記録とアラートの要件を管理する必要があります。Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus のルール管理では、AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) ポリシーを使用してルールへのアクセスを制御できるため、各チームは rulegroupnamespaces でグループ化された独自のルールとアラートを制御できます。 以下の画像は、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus のルール管理に追加された devops と engg という 2 つの rulegroupnamespaces の例を示しています。 以下の JSON は、リソース ARN で指定された devops rulegroupnamespace (上記参照) へのアクセスを制限するサンプル IAM ポリシーです。以下の IAM ポリシーの注目すべきアクションは、PutRuleGroupsNamespace と DeleteRuleGroupsNamespace で、これらは AMP ワークスペースの rulegroupsnamespace の指定されたリソース ARN に制限されています。ポリシーが作成されると、必要なアクセス制御要件に応じて、任意のユーザー、グループ、またはロールに割り当てることができます。IAM ポリシーのアクションは、必要かつ許可されるアクションに基づいて、IAM アクセス許可 に従って変更/制限できます。 { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"VisualEditor0\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"aps:RemoteWrite\", \"aps:DescribeRuleGroupsNamespace\",

このページの見出し key-performance-indicators 1.0 KPI（「ゴールデンシグナル」）の理解​ 組織は、ビジネスやオペレーションの健全性やリスクに関する洞察を提供する重要業績評価指標（KPI）、別名「ゴールデンシグナル」を活用しています。 組織の各部門は、それぞれの成果を測定するための独自の KPI を持っています。 例えば、e コマースアプリケーションのプロダクトチームは、カート注文の処理成功率を KPI として追跡します。 オンコール運用チームは、インシデントの平均検出時間（MTTD）を KPI として測定します。 財務チームにとっては、予算内のリソースコストが重要な KPI となります。 Service Level Indicator (SLI)、Service Level Objective (SLO)、Service Level Agreement (SLA) は、サービス信頼性管理の重要な要素です。 このガイドでは、Amazon CloudWatch とその機能を使用して SLI、SLO、SLA を計算し監視するためのベストプラクティスを、明確で簡潔な例とともに説明します。 SLI (Service Level Indicator)： サービスのパフォーマンスを定量的に測定する指標です。 SLO (Service Level Objective)： SLI の目標値で、望ましいパフォーマンスレベルを表します。 SLA (Service Level Agreement)： サービスプロバイダーとユーザー間で期待されるサービスレベルを規定する契約です。 一般的な SLI の例： 可用性：サービスが稼働している時間の割合 レイテンシー：リクエストの処理に要する時間 エラー率：失敗したリクエストの割合 2.0 顧客とステークホルダーの要件を把握する（以下のテンプレートを使用）​ 最上位の質問から始めます：「対象のワークロード（決済ポータル、eコマース注文、ユーザー登録、データレポート、サポートポータルなど）におけるビジネス価値または解決すべきビジネス課題は何か」

分間のウィンドウで小さな割合の障害を許容する可能性がある) などの要件を測定する方法を策定します。 さまざまなビジネス機能の成果に沿った目的に合わせたスキーマを持つ効果的なタグ付け戦略を構築します。 これは特にオペレーショナルオブザーバビリティとインシデント管理をカバーする必要があります。 可能な場合は、機械学習アルゴリズムを使用してベースラインを確立する CloudWatch 異常検出 を使用して、アラームの動的しきい値を活用します (特にベースライン KPI がないメトリクスの場合)。 CloudWatch メトリクス (または Prometheus メトリクスなどの他のソース) を公開する AWS の利用可能なサービスを使用してアラームを設定する場合は、アラームノイズを減らすために複合アラームの作成を検討してください。 例: デプロイメント中に両方が重要なしきい値を下回った場合にアラームを発する、可用性を示すビジネスメトリクス (成功したリクエストによって追跡) とレイテンシーで構成される複合アラームは、デプロイメントのバグを示す決定的な指標となる可能性があります。 (注: AWS ビジネスサポート以上が必要) AWS は、Personal Health Dashboard でリソースに関連する関心のあるイベントを公開しています。 AWS Health Aware (AHA) フレームワーク (AWS Health を使用) を活用して、中央アカウント (管理アカウントなど) から AWS Organization 全体で集約された予防的およびリアルタイムのアラートを取り込みます。 これらのアラートは、Slack などの優先的なコミュニケーションプラットフォームに送信でき、ServiceNow や Jira などの ITSM ツールと統合されます。 Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights を活用して、リソースの最適なモニターを設定し、アプリケーションの問題の兆候を継続的にデータ分析します。 また、監視対象のアプリケーションの潜在的な問題を示す自動化されたダッシュボードを提供し、アプリケーション/インフラストラクチャの問題を迅速に分離/トラブルシューティングできます。 Container Insights を活用してコンテナからメトリクスとログを集約し、CloudWatch Application Insights とシームレスに統合できます。 AWS Resilience Hub を活用して、定義された RTO と RPO に対してアプリケーションを分析します。 AWS Fault Injection Simulator などのツールを使用した制御された実験を使用して、可用性、レイテンシー、事業継続性の要件が満たされているかを検証します。 追加の Well-Architected レビューとサービス固有の詳細な分析を実施して、ワークロードが AWS のベストプラクティスに従ってビジネス要件を満たすように設計されていることを確認します。 詳細については、AWS オブザーバビリティのベストプラクティスガイダンス、AWS Cloud Adoption Framework: 運用の観点ホワイトペーパー、および AWS Well-Architected Framework

SLI、SLO、SLA の計算に Amazon CloudWatch と Metric Math を使用する​ 4.1 Amazon CloudWatch と Metric Math​ Amazon CloudWatch は、AWS リソースのモニタリングとオブザーバビリティのサービスを提供します。Metric Math を使用すると、CloudWatch のメトリクスデータを使用して計算を実行できるため、Service Level Indicator、Service Level Objective、Service Level Agreement を計算するための理想的なツールとなります。 4.1.1 詳細モニタリングの有効化​ AWS リソースの詳細モニタリングを有効にすると、1 分間隔でのデータ粒度が得られ、より正確な SLI の計算が可能になります。 4.1.2 名前空間とディメンションを使用したメトリクスの整理​ 名前空間とディメンションを使用して、メトリクスを分類およびフィルタリングし、分析を容易にします。 例えば、名前空間を使用して特定のサービスに関連するメトリクスをグループ化し、ディメンションを使用してそのサービスの各インスタンスを区別します。 4.2 Metric Math を使用した SLI の計算​ 4.2.1 可用性​ 可用性を計算するには、成功したリクエストの数を総リクエスト数で割ります。 availability = 100 * (successful_requests / total_requests) 例： API Gateway で以下のメトリクスがあるとします： 4XXError: 4xx クライアントエラーの数 5XXError: 5xx サーバーエラーの数 Count: 総リクエスト数 Metric Math を使用して可用性を計算します： availability = 100 * ((Count - 4XXError - 5XXError) / Count) 4.2.2 レイテンシー​ 平均レイテンシーを計算するには、CloudWatch が提供する SampleCount と Sum 統計を使用します。 average_latency = Sum / SampleCount 例： Lambda 関数に以下のメトリクスがあるとします： Duration: 関数の実行にかかった時間 Metric Math を使用して平均レイテンシーを計算します： average_latency = Duration.Sum / Duration.SampleCount 4.2.3 エラー率​ エラー率を計算するには、失敗したリクエストの数を総リクエスト数で割ります： error_rate = 100 * (failed_requests / total_requests) 例： 先ほどの API Gateway の例を使用すると： error_rate = 100 * ((4XXError + 5XXError) / Count) 4.4 SLO の定義とモニタリング​ 4.4.1 現実的な目標の設定​ ユーザーの期待値と過去のパフォーマンスデータに基づいて SLO の目標を定義します。 サービスの信頼性とリソース使用率のバランスを確保するために、達成可能な目標を設定します。 4.4.2 CloudWatch を使用した SLO のモニタリング​ CloudWatch アラームを作成して SLI をモニタリングし、SLO のターゲットに近づいたり超過したりした場合に通知を受け取ることができます。 これにより、問題に事前に対処し、サービスの信頼性を維持することができます。 4.4.3 SLO のレビューと調整​ サービスの進化に合わせて SLO が適切であり続けるよう、定期的にレビューを行います。 必要に応じて目標値を調整し、変更内容をステークホルダーに伝えます。 4.5 SLA の定義と測定​ 4.5.1 現実的な目標の設定​ 過去のパフォーマンスデータとユーザーの期待に基づいて SLA 目標を定義します。 サービスの信頼性とリソースの使用率のバランスを確保するために、達成可能な目標を設定します。 4.5.2 モニタリングとアラート​ CloudWatch アラームを設定して SLI を監視し、SLA のターゲットに近づいたり超過したりした場合に通知を受け取るようにします。 これにより、問題に事前に対処し、サービスの信頼性を維持することができます。 4.5.3 SLA の定期的なレビュー​ サービスの進化に合わせて SLA が適切であり続けるよう、定期的にレビューを行います。 必要に応じて目標値を調整し、変更内容をステークホルダーに伝えます。 4.6 一定期間における SLA または SLO のパフォーマンス測定​ カレンダー月などの一定期間における SLA または SLO のパフォーマンスを測定するには、カスタム時間範囲を持つ CloudWatch メトリクスデータを使用します。 例： API Gateway で可用性の SLO 目標を 99.9% に設定しているとします。4 月の可用性を測定するには、以下の Metric Math 式を使用します： availability = 100 * ((Count - 4XXError - 5XXError) / Count) 次に、CloudWatch メトリクスデータのクエリをカスタム時間範囲で設定します： 開始時刻： 2023-04-01T00:00:00Z 終了時刻： 2023-04-30T23:59:59Z 期間： 2592000 (30 日間を秒で表示) 最後に、AVG 統計を使用して月間の平均可用性を計算します。平均可用性が SLO 目標以上であれば、目標を達成したことになります。 5.0 まとめ​ 重要業績評価指標 (KPI)、別名「ゴールデンシグナル」は、ビジネスとステークホルダーの要件に合わせる必要があります。 Amazon CloudWatch と Metric Math を使用して SLI、SLO、SLA を計算することは、サービスの信頼性を管理する上で重要です。 AWS リソースのパフォーマンスを効果的に監視・維持するために、このガイドで説明したベストプラクティスに従ってください。 詳細モニタリングを有効にし、名前空間とディメンションでメトリクスを整理し、SLI の計算に Metric Math を使用し、現実的な SLO と SLA のターゲットを設定し、CloudWatch アラームで監視とアラートのシステムを確立することを忘れないでください。

では、以下のようにミッションを掲げています： Amazon は、地球上で最も顧客中心的な企業、最高の雇用主、そして最も安全な職場であることを目指しています。 — About Amazon IT において、すべてのプロジェクト、デプロイメント、セキュリティ対策、最適化は、ビジネスの成果に向けて機能するべきです。当たり前のことですが、ビジネスに価値を付加しないことは行うべきではありません。ITIL では次のように述べています： すべての変更はビジネス価値を提供すべきである。 — ITIL Service Transition, AXELOS, 2011, page 44. — Change Management in the Cloud AWS Whitepaper を参照 ミッションとビジネス価値が重要なのは、それらがあなたの行うすべてのことに影響を与えるべきだからです。オブザーバビリティには多くの利点があります： 可用性の向上 信頼性の向上 アプリケーションの健全性とパフォーマンスの理解 より良いコラボレーション 問題の事前検出 顧客満足度の向上 市場投入までの時間短縮 運用コストの削減 自動化 これらの利点には共通点があります。それは、直接的または間接的に、顧客や組織にビジネス価値を提供することです。オブザーバビリティについて考える際は、アプリケーションがビジネス価値を提供しているかどうかを常に考える必要があります。 つまり、オブザーバビリティは、ビジネス価値の提供に貢献する要素を測定し、ビジネスの成果とそのリスクに焦点を当てるべきです。顧客が望むもの、必要とするものについて考える必要があります。 どこから始めるべきですか？​ 何が重要かを理解したら、次は何を測定する必要があるかを考える必要があります。Amazon では、お客様のニーズから始めて、そこから逆算して考えます。 私たちは、必要に迫られる前に、サービスを改善し、特典や機能を追加するよう内部から動機付けられています。必要に迫られる前に、価格を下げ、お客様への価値を高めます。必要に迫られる前に、私たちは発明します。 — Jeff Bezos、2012 年株主レター e コマースサイトを使用した簡単な例を見てみましょう。まず、オンラインで商品を購入する際にお客様として何を求めるかを考えてみましょう。誰もが同じとは限りませんが、おそらく以下のような点を気にするでしょう： 配送 価格 セキュリティ ページ速度 検索（探している商品を見つけられるか？） お客様が重視することが分かれば、それらを測定し、ビジネスの成果にどのように影響するかを把握し始めることができます。ページ速度は、コンバージョン率と検索エンジンランキングに直接影響を与えます。2017 年の調査では、モバイルユーザーの半数以上（53%）が、ページの読み込みに 3 秒以上かかると離脱することが示されています。もちろん、ページ速度の重要性を示す研究は多数あり、これは明らかに測定すべきメトリクスですが、コンバージョンに測定可能な影響があるため、測定して行動を起こす必要があり、そのデータを使用して改善を行うことができます。 Working Backwards​ お客様が気にかけているすべてのことを知ることは期待できません。 このコンテンツを読んでいるあなたは、おそらく技術職に就いていることでしょう。 組織内のステークホルダーと話をする必要がありますが、これは必ずしも容易ではありません。 しかし、重要なものを測定するためには不可欠です。 e コマースの例を続けてみましょう。 今回は検索について考えてみます。 商品を購入するためには検索機能が必要なことは明白かもしれませんが、Forrester Research のレポートによると、訪問者の 43% が直接検索ボックスに移動し、検索を使用する人は使用しない人と比べて 2 ～ 3 倍の確率で購入に至ることをご存知でしょうか。 検索は非常に重要で、適切に機能する必要があり、モニタリングが必要です。 特定の検索で結果が得られないことが判明し、単純なパターンマッチングから自然言語処理に移行する必要があるかもしれません。 これは、ビジネスの成果をモニタリングし、顧客体験を改善するための行動を起こす例です。 Amazon では： 私たちは、お客様を深く理解し、お客様の課題から Working Backwards することで、お客様の生活に意味のあるソリューションを生み出すイノベーションを迅速に開発するよう努めています。 — Daniel Slater - Worldwide Lead, Culture of Innovation, AWS (Elements of Amazon's Day 1 Culture より) 私たちは、お客様から始めて、そのニーズから Working Backwards します。 これはビジネスで成功する唯一のアプローチではありませんが、オブザーバビリティにおいては良いアプローチです。 ステークホルダーと協力して、お客様にとって重要なことを理解し、そこから Working Backwards します。 さらなる利点として、お客様やステークホルダーにとって重要なメトリクスを収集することで、ほぼリアルタイムのダッシュボードで可視化でき、「ランディングページの読み込みにどのくらい時間がかかっているか？」や「ウェブサイトの運用コストはいくらか？」といった質問に対するレポートの作成や回答を避けることができます。 ステークホルダーや経営陣は、この情報をセルフサービスで取得できるはずです。 これらは、アプリケーションにとって本当に重要な高レベルのメトリクスであり、また問題があることを示す最良の指標でもあります。 例えば、特定の期間に通常期待される注文数が少ないことを示すアラートは、お客様に影響を与える問題が発生している可能性を示しています。 一方、サーバーのボリュームがほぼ満杯であることや、特定のサービスで 5xx エラーが多数発生していることを示すアラートは、修正が必要な可能性がありますが、顧客への影響を理解し、それに応じて優先順位付けを行う必要があります。 これには時間がかかる場合があります。 これらの高レベルのビジネスメトリクスを測定していれば、お客様に影響を与える問題を簡単に特定できます。 これらのメトリクスは、何が起きているかを示します。 トレーシングやログなどの他のメトリクスや他の形式のオブザーバビリティは、なぜこれが起きているのかを示し、それを修正または改善するために何ができるかを導き出します。 観察すべきこと​ 顧客にとって重要なことが分かったら、重要業績評価指標 (KPI) を特定できます。 これらは、ビジネスの成果が危険にさらされているかどうかを示す高レベルのメトリクスです。 また、これらの KPI に影響を与える可能性のある多くの異なるソースから情報を収集する必要があります。 ここで、KPI に影響を与える可能性のあるメトリクスについて考え始める必要があります。 先ほど説明したように、5xx エラーの数は影響を示すものではありませんが、KPI に影響を与える可能性があります。 ビジネスの成果に影響を与えるものから、ビジネスの成果に影響を与える可能性のあるものまで、逆算して考えていきます。 収集する必要があるものが分かったら、KPI を測定するために使用できるメトリクスと、それらの KPI に影響を与える可能性のある関連メトリクスを提供する情報源を特定する必要があります。 これが観察の基礎となります。 このデータは、メトリクス、ログ、トレースから得られる可能性が高いです。 このデータを入手したら、成果が危険にさらされているときにアラートを出すために使用できます。 その後、影響を評価し、問題の解決を試みることができます。 ほとんどの場合、CPU やメモリなどの個別の技術的なメトリクスが問題を示す前に、このデータが問題を示してくれます。 オブザーバビリティは、ビジネスの成果に影響を与える問題を修正するために事後的に使用することも、顧客の検索体験を改善するために事前に使用することもできます。 まとめ​ CPU、RAM、ディスク容量、その他の技術的なメトリクスは、スケーリング、パフォーマンス、容量、コストにとって重要ですが、アプリケーションの実際の状態を把握したり、顧客体験に関する洞察を得たりすることはできません。 重要なのは顧客であり、監視すべきは顧客の体験です。 そのため、顧客の要件から Working Backwards で考え、ステークホルダーと協力して、重要な KPI とメトリクスを確立する必要があります。 このページを編集 前へ Java Spring Integration アプリケーションの計装 次へ パーセンタイルの重要性 本当に重要なことは何か？ どこから始めるべきですか？ Working Backwards 観察すべきこと

パーセンタイルの重要性 パーセンタイルは、モニタリングとレポーティングにおいて重要です。これは、平均値だけに頼るのではなく、データ分布のより詳細で正確な視点を提供するためです。 平均値は、パフォーマンスやユーザーエクスペリエンスに大きな影響を与える可能性のある外れ値やデータの変動などの重要な情報を隠してしまうことがあります。 一方、パーセンタイルはこれらの隠れた詳細を明らかにし、データの分布をより良く理解することができます。 Amazon CloudWatch では、アプリケーションやインフラストラクチャ全体のレスポンスタイム、レイテンシー、エラー率などのさまざまなメトリクスを監視およびレポートするためにパーセンタイルを使用できます。 パーセンタイルにアラームを設定することで、特定のパーセンタイル値が閾値を超えた場合にアラートを受け取り、より多くの顧客に影響が及ぶ前に対策を講じることができます。 CloudWatch のパーセンタイル を使用するには、CloudWatch コンソールの All metrics でメトリクスを選択し、既存のメトリクスを使用して statistic を p99 に設定します。p の後の値を任意のパーセンタイルに編集することができます。 その後、パーセンタイルのグラフを表示し、CloudWatch ダッシュボード に追加し、これらのメトリクスにアラームを設定できます。 たとえば、レスポンスタイムの 95 パーセンタイルが特定の閾値を超えた場合にアラートを通知するように設定し、多くのユーザーが遅いレスポンスタイムを経験していることを示すことができます。 以下のヒストグラムは、Amazon Managed Grafana で CloudWatch RUM ログから CloudWath Logs Insights クエリを使用して作成されました。 使用されたクエリは以下の通りです： fields @timestamp, event_details.duration | filter event_type =

2 秒未満かかっていることを示しています。 上のヒストグラムから、ほとんどのページは 1 秒未満で読み込まれており、外れ値があることがわかります。 同じデータをパーセンタイル (p99) で使用すると、問題があることがわかります。 CloudWatch のグラフは、ページロードの 99% が 23 秒未満であることを示しています。 これをより視覚化しやすくするために、以下のグラフは平均値と 99 パーセンタイルを比較しています。 この場合、目標のページロード時間は 2 秒です。代替の CloudWatch 統計 と Metric Math を使用して他の計算を行うことができます。 この場合、パーセンタイルランク (PR) を統計 PR(:2000) で使用して、ページロードの 92.7% が目標の 2000ms 以内で発生していることを示しています。 CloudWatch でパーセンタイルを使用することで、システムのパフォーマンスについてより深い洞察を得ることができ、問題を早期に検出し、隠れている可能性のある外れ値を特定することで顧客のエクスペリエンスを向上させることができます。 このページを編集 前へ なぜオブザーバビリティが必要なのか？ 次へ

のモニタリングとオブザーバビリティのベストプラクティス このページの見出し AWS における Databricks のモニタリングとオブザーバビリティのベストプラクティス Databricks は、データ分析と AI/ML ワークロードを管理するためのプラットフォームです。このガイドは、AWS のネイティブなオブザーバビリティサービスやマネージド型オープンソースサービスを使用して、AWS 上の Databricks でワークロードを実行しているお客様のモニタリングをサポートすることを目的としています。 Databricks をモニタリングする理由​ Databricks クラスターを管理する運用チームは、統合されたカスタマイズ可能なダッシュボードを活用することで、以下のような恩恵を受けることができます： ワークロードのステータス、エラー、パフォーマンスのボトルネックの追跡 時間経過に伴う総リソース使用量やエラー率など、望ましくない動作に対するアラート設定 ルート原因分析やカスタマイズされたメトリクスの抽出のための一元化されたログ管理 監視すべき項目​ Databricks は、クラスターインスタンスで Apache Spark を実行しており、メトリクスを公開するネイティブ機能を備えています。 これらのメトリクスは、ドライバー、ワーカー、およびクラスターで実行されているワークロードに関する情報を提供します。 Spark を実行しているインスタンスには、ストレージ、CPU、メモリ、ネットワークに関する追加の有用な情報があります。 Databricks クラスターのパフォーマンスにどのような外部要因が影響を与える可能性があるかを理解することが重要です。 多数のインスタンスを持つクラスターの場合、ボトルネックと全体的な健全性を理解することも同様に重要です。 モニタリング方法​ コレクターとその依存関係をインストールするには、Databricks の初期化スクリプトが必要です。これらのスクリプトは、Databricks クラスターの各インスタンスで起動時に実行されます。 また、Databricks クラスターには、インスタンスプロファイルを使用してメトリクスとログを送信するための権限が必要です。 最後に、Databricks クラスターの Spark 設定でメトリクス名前空間を設定することがベストプラクティスです。testApp をクラスターの適切な参照に置き換えてください。 図 1: メトリクス名前空間の Spark 設定例 DataBricks における優れたオブザーバビリティソリューションの主要な要素​ 1) メトリクス: メトリクスは、一定期間にわたって測定されたアクティビティや特定のプロセスを表す数値です。Databricks には以下のような種類のメトリクスがあります： CPU、メモリ、ディスク、ネットワークなどのシステムリソースレベルのメトリクス。 カスタムメトリクスソース、StreamingQueryListener、QueryExecutionListener を使用したアプリケーションメトリクス。 MetricsSystem によって公開される Spark メトリクス。 2) ログ: ログは発生した一連のイベントを表現し、それらについて線形的なストーリーを語ります。Databricks には以下のような種類のログがあります： イベントログ 監査ログ ドライバーログ：stdout、stderr、log4j カスタムログ（構造化ログを有効化） エグゼキュターログ：stdout、stderr、log4j カスタムログ（構造化ログを有効化） 3) トレース: スタックトレースはエンドツーエンドの可視性を提供し、ステージ全体を通したフローを表示します。これは、エラーやパフォーマンスの問題を引き起こすステージやコードを特定するためのデバッグ時に役立ちます。 4) ダッシュボード: ダッシュボードは、アプリケーションやサービスのゴールデンメトリクスの優れた概要ビューを提供します。 5) アラート: アラートは、対応が必要な状況についてエンジニアに通知します。 AWS ネイティブのオブザーバビリティオプション​ Ganglia UI や Log Delivery などのネイティブソリューションは、システムメトリクスの収集や Apache Spark™ メトリクスのクエリに優れたソリューションです。しかし、以下のような改善の余地がある領域があります： Ganglia はアラートをサポートしていません。 Ganglia はログから派生したメトリクス（例：ERROR ログの増加率）の作成をサポートしていません。 データの正確性、データの鮮度、エンドツーエンドのレイテンシーに関連する SLO (Service Level Objectives) や SLI (Service Level Indicators) を追跡するカスタムダッシュボードを使用して、Ganglia で可視化することができません。 Amazon CloudWatch は、AWS 上の Databricks クラスターを監視・管理するための重要なツールです。クラスターのパフォーマンスに関する貴重な洞察を提供し、問題の迅速な特定と解決を支援します。Databricks と CloudWatch の統合および構造化ログの有効化により、これらの領域を改善することができます。CloudWatch Application Insights はログに含まれるフィールドを自動的に検出し、CloudWatch Logs Insights は目的に特化したクエリ言語を提供してデバッグと分析を迅速化します。 図 2：Databricks CloudWatch アーキテクチャ CloudWatch を使用して Databricks を監視する方法の詳細については、以下を参照してください： How to Monitor Databricks with Amazon CloudWatch オープンソースソフトウェアのオブザーバビリティオプション​ Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus は、Prometheus 互換のモニタリングマネージドサービスで、サーバーレスで提供されます。メトリクスの保存と、それらのメトリクスに基づいて作成されたアラートの管理を担当します。Prometheus は人気のあるオープンソースモニタリング技術で、Kubernetes に次ぐ Cloud Native Computing Foundation の 2 番目のプロジェクトです。 Amazon Managed Grafana は、Grafana のマネージドサービスです。Grafana は時系列データの可視化のためのオープンソース技術で、オブザーバビリティによく使用されています。Grafana を使用して、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus、Amazon CloudWatch など、さまざまなソースからのデータを可視化できます。Databricks のメトリクスとアラートの可視化に使用されます。 AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry は、AWS がサポートする OpenTelemetry プロジェクトのディストリビューションで、トレースとメトリクスを収集するためのオープンソース標準、ライブラリ、サービスを提供します。OpenTelemetry を通じて、Prometheus や StatsD などのさまざまなオブザーバビリティデータ形式を収集し、このデータを強化して、CloudWatch や Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus などの複数の送信先に送信できます。 ユースケース​ AWS ネイティブサービスは Databricks クラスターを管理するために必要なオブザーバビリティを提供しますが、オープンソースのマネージドサービスを使用することが最適な選択となるシナリオもあります。 Prometheus と Grafana は非常に人気のあるテクノロジーで、多くの企業ですでに使用されています。AWS のオブザーバビリティ向けオープンソースサービスを使用することで、運用チームは既存のインフラストラクチャ、同じクエリ言語、既存のダッシュボードとアラートを使用して Databricks ワークロードを監視できます。その際、これらのサービスのインフラストラクチャ、スケーラビリティ、パフォーマンスの管理に関する負担を軽減できます。 ADOT は、CloudWatch や Prometheus などの異なる送信先にメトリクスとトレースを送信する必要がある場合や、OTLP や StatsD などの異なるタイプのデータソースを扱う必要があるチームにとって、最適な選択肢です。 最後に、Amazon Managed Grafana は CloudWatch や Prometheus を含む多くの異なるデータソースをサポートし、複数のツールを使用することを決めたチームのデータ相関を支援します。また、すべての Databricks クラスターのオブザーバビリティを可能にするテンプレートの作成や、Infrastructure as Code を通じてプロビジョニングと設定を可能にする強力な API を提供します。 図 3: Databricks オープンソースオブザーバビリティアーキテクチャ AWS のオブザーバビリティ向けマネージドオープンソースサービスを使用して Databricks クラスターからメトリクスを観測するには、メトリクスとアラートの可視化のための Amazon Managed Grafana ワークスペースと、Amazon Managed Grafana ワークスペースのデータソースとして設定された Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus ワークスペースが必要です。 収集する必要がある重要なメトリクスには、Spark メトリクスとノードメトリクスの 2 種類があります。 Spark メトリクスは、クラスター内の現在のワーカー数やエグゼキューター数、処理中にノード間でデータを交換する際のシャッフル、RAM とディスク間でデータが移動するスピルなどの情報を提供します。これらのメトリクスを公開するには、Databricks 管理コンソールで Spark ネイティブの Prometheus（バージョン 3.0 以降で利用可能）を有効にし、init_script を通じて設定する必要があります。 ディスク使用量、CPU 時間、メモリ、ストレージパフォーマンスなどのノードメトリクスを追跡するには、node_exporter を使用します。これは追加の設定なしで使用できますが、重要なメトリクスのみを公開するようにすべきです。 ADOT Collector は、クラスターの各ノードにインストールする必要があります。これは Spark と node_exporter の両方から公開されたメトリクスをスクレイピングし、メトリクスをフィルタリングし、cluster_name などのメタデータを注入して、これらのメトリクスを Prometheus ワークスペースに送信します。 ADOT Collector と node_exporter の両方を init_script を通じてインストールおよび設定する必要があります。 Databricks クラスターは、Prometheus ワークスペースにメトリクスを書き込む権限を持つ IAM ロールで設定する必要があります。 ベスト プラクティス​ 価値のあるメトリクスを優先する​ Spark と node_exporter は、複数のメトリクスと同じメトリクスの複数のフォーマットを公開しています。 監視とインシデント対応に有用なメトリクスをフィルタリングしないと、問題検出までの平均時間が増加し、サンプルの保存コストが増加し、価値のある情報を見つけて理解することが難しくなります。 OpenTelemetry の Processors を使用することで、価値のあるメトリクスのみをフィルタリングして保持したり、意味のないメトリクスをフィルタリングで除外したり、AMP に送信する前にメトリクスを集計して計算したりすることが可能です。 アラート疲れを防ぐ​ 価値のあるメトリクスが AMP に取り込まれたら、アラートを設定することが重要です。 しかし、リソース使用量のすべてのバーストに対してアラートを設定すると、アラート疲れを引き起こす可能性があります。 これは、ノイズが多すぎるとアラートの重要度への信頼性が低下し、重要なイベントが検出されなくなる状態です。 複数の関連するアラートが個別の通知を生成するような曖昧さを避けるために、AMP のアラートルールのグループ機能を使用する必要があります。 また、アラートには適切な重要度を設定し、ビジネスの優先順位を反映させる必要があります。 Amazon Managed Grafana ダッシュボードの再利用​ Amazon Managed Grafana は、Grafana のネイティブなテンプレート機能を活用しています。これにより、既存および新規の Databricks クラスターすべてのダッシュボードを作成できます。 各クラスターに対して手動で可視化を作成し、維持管理する必要がなくなります。 この機能を使用するには、クラスターごとにメトリクスをグループ化するための適切なラベルが必要です。 これも OpenTelemetry プロセッサーで実現可能です。

Amazon Managed Grafana の Grafana リソースと Grafana ダッシュボードのライフサイクルを作成・管理する方法を理解したい開発者やアーキテクトを対象としています。 はじめに​ お客様は、オープンソースの分析とモニタリングソリューションのためのオブザーバビリティプラットフォームとして Grafana を使用しています。Amazon EKS でワークロードを実行しているお客様は、ワークロードの重要性に焦点を当て、Kubernetes ネイティブのコントローラーを使用して Cloud リソースなどの外部リソースのデプロイとライフサイクル管理に依存したいと考えています。お客様は AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK) をインストールして、AWS サービスの作成、デプロイ、管理を行っています。最近では、多くのお客様が Prometheus と Grafana の実装をマネージドサービスに移行することを選択しており、AWS の場合、これらのサービスはワークロードのモニタリングのために Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus と Amazon Managed Grafana を使用しています。 お客様が Grafana を使用する際の一般的な課題の 1 つは、Kubernetes クラスターから Amazon Managed Grafana などの外部 Grafana インスタンスで Grafana リソースと Grafana ダッシュボードを作成し、そのライフサイクルを管理することです。お客様は、Amazon Managed Grafana でのGrafana リソースの作成も含めて、Git ベースのワークフローを使用してシステム全体のインフラストラクチャとアプリケーションのデプロイを完全に自動化し管理する方法を見つけることに課題を抱えています。このオブザーバビリティのベストプラクティスガイドでは、以下のトピックに焦点を当てます： Grafana Operator の紹介 - Kubernetes クラスターから外部 Grafana インスタンスを管理するための Kubernetes オペレーター GitOps の紹介 - Git ベースのワークフローを使用してインフラストラクチャを作成および管理する自動化メカニズム Amazon EKS で Grafana Operator を使用して Amazon Managed Grafana を管理する Amazon EKS で Flux を使用した GitOps で Amazon Managed Grafana を管理する Grafana Operator の概要​ grafana-operator は、Kubernetes 内の Grafana インスタンスの管理を支援するために構築された Kubernetes オペレーターです。 Grafana Operator を使用すると、複数のインスタンス間で Grafana ダッシュボードやデータソースなどを宣言的に作成・管理することが容易にできます。 Grafana Operator は現在、Amazon Managed Grafana のような外部環境でホストされているダッシュボードやデータソースなどのリソースの管理もサポートしています。 これにより、Flux などの CNCF プロジェクトを使用した GitOps メカニズムを活用して、Amazon EKS クラスターから Amazon Managed Grafana のリソースを作成し、そのライフサイクルを管理することが可能になります。 GitOps の概要​ GitOps と Flux とは​ GitOps は、Git をデプロイ設定の信頼できる情報源として使用するソフトウェア開発および運用手法です。 アプリケーションやインフラストラクチャの望ましい状態を Git リポジトリに保持し、Git ベースのワークフローを使用して変更を管理およびデプロイします。 GitOps は、システム全体を Git リポジトリで宣言的に記述することで、アプリケーションとインフラストラクチャのデプロイを管理する方法です。 これは、バージョン管理、イミュータブル(不変性)なアーティファクト、自動化のベストプラクティスを活用して、複数の Kubernetes クラスターの状態を管理する能力を提供する運用モデルです。 Flux は、Kubernetes 上のアプリケーションのデプロイを自動化する GitOps ツールです。 Git リポジトリの状態を継続的に監視し、クラスターに変更を適用することで機能します。 Flux は、GitHub、GitLab、Bitbucket などの様々な Git プロバイダーと統合されています。 リポジトリに変更が加えられると、Flux は自動的にそれを検出し、それに応じてクラスターを更新します。 Flux を使用するメリット​ 自動デプロイ: Flux はデプロイプロセスを自動化し、手動によるエラーを減らし、開発者が他のタスクに集中できるようにします。 Git ベースのワークフロー: Flux は Git をソースオブトゥルースとして活用し、変更の追跡とロールバックを容易にします。 宣言的な設定: Flux は Kubernetes マニフェストを使用してクラスターの望ましい状態を定義し、変更の管理と追跡を容易にします。 Flux 導入における課題​ カスタマイズの制限: Flux がサポートするカスタマイズは限定的で、すべてのユースケースに適していない可能性があります。 急な学習曲線: Flux は新規ユーザーにとって学習曲線が急で、Kubernetes と Git の深い理解が必要です。 Amazon EKS で Grafana Operator を使用して Amazon Managed Grafana のリソースを管理する​ 前のセクションで説明したように、Grafana Operator を使用すると、Kubernetes クラスターを使用して、Kubernetes ネイティブな方法で Amazon Managed Grafana のリソースを作成し、ライフサイクルを管理できます。以下のアーキテクチャ図は、Grafana Operator を使用してコントロールプレーンとして Kubernetes クラスターを使用し、AMG でアイデンティティを設定し、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus をデータソースとして追加し、Kubernetes ネイティブな方法で Amazon EKS クラスターから Amazon Managed Grafana にダッシュボードを作成する方法を示しています。 上記のソリューションを Amazon EKS クラスターにデプロイする方法の詳細なデモンストレーションについては、Using Open Source Grafana Operator on your Kubernetes cluster to manage Amazon Managed Grafana を参照してください。 Amazon EKS で Flux を使用した GitOps による Amazon Managed Grafana リソースの管理​ 前述のように、Flux は Kubernetes 上のアプリケーションのデプロイを自動化します。 GitHub などの Git リポジトリの状態を継続的に監視し、リポジトリに変更が加えられると、Flux は自動的にそれを検出してクラスターを更新します。 以下のアーキテクチャ図は、Kubernetes クラスターから Grafana Operator を使用し、Flux による GitOps メカニズムを使って、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus をデータソースとして追加し、Kubernetes ネイティブな方法で Amazon Managed Grafana

ベースのサーバーレスオブザーバビリティ 分散システムとサーバーレスコンピューティングの世界では、アプリケーションの信頼性とパフォーマンスを確保するためにオブザーバビリティが重要です。 これは従来のモニタリング以上のものを含んでいます。 Amazon CloudWatch や AWS X-Ray などの AWS オブザーバビリティツールを活用することで、サーバーレスアプリケーションの洞察を得て、問題のトラブルシューティングを行い、アプリケーションのパフォーマンスを最適化できます。 このガイドでは、Lambda ベースのサーバーレスアプリケーションのオブザーバビリティを実装するための重要な概念、ツール、ベストプラクティスについて学びます。 インフラストラクチャやアプリケーションのオブザーバビリティを実装する前の最初のステップは、主要な目標を決定することです。 それは、ユーザーエクスペリエンスの向上、開発者の生産性の向上、Service Level Objective (SLO) の達成、ビジネス収益の増加、またはアプリケーションの種類に応じた他の特定の目標かもしれません。 そのため、これらの主要な目標を明確に定義し、それらをどのように測定するかを確立してください。 そこから Working Backwards してオブザーバビリティ戦略を設計します。 詳細については、「Monitor what matters」を参照してください。 オブザーバビリティの柱​ オブザーバビリティには 3 つの主要な柱があります： ログ：アプリケーションやシステム内で発生した障害、エラー、状態変更などの個別のイベントを記録したタイムスタンプ付きの記録 メトリクス：様々な時間間隔で測定された数値データ（時系列データ）、SLI（リクエストレート、エラーレート、所要時間、CPU 使用率など） トレース：複数のアプリケーションやシステム（通常はマイクロサービス）にまたがる単一のユーザーの行動を表すもの AWS は、AWS Lambda アプリケーションの実用的なインサイトを得るために、ネイティブおよびオープンソースのツールを提供し、ログ記録、メトリクスのモニタリング、トレースを可能にします。 ログ​ オブザーバビリティのベストプラクティスガイドのこのセクションでは、以下のトピックについて詳しく説明します： 非構造化ログと構造化ログの比較 CloudWatch Logs Insights ログの相関 ID Lambda Powertools を使用したコードサンプル CloudWatch Dashboards を使用したログの可視化 CloudWatch Logs の保持期間 ログは、アプリケーション内で発生した個別のイベントです。 これには、障害、エラー、実行パス、その他のイベントが含まれます。 ログは、非構造化、半構造化、または構造化された形式で記録できます。 非構造化ログと構造化ログ​ 開発者は、アプリケーション内で print や console.log ステートメントを使用した単純なログメッセージから始めることがよくあります。 これらは、プログラムによる解析が難しく、特に異なるロググループにわたって多くのログメッセージを生成する AWS Lambda ベースのアプリケーションでは、スケールに応じた解析が困難です。 その結果、CloudWatch でこれらのログを統合することは困難で、分析が難しくなります。 ログ内の関連情報を見つけるには、テキストマッチや正規表現を使用する必要があります。 以下は、非構造化ログの例です： [2023-07-19T19:59:07Z] INFO Request started [2023-07-19T19:59:07Z] INFO AccessDenied: Could not access resource [2023-07-19T19:59:08Z] INFO Request finished ご覧のように、ログメッセージには一貫した構造がなく、有用な洞察を得ることが困難です。 また、コンテキスト情報を追加することも難しくなっています。 一方、構造化ログは、情報を一貫したフォーマット（多くの場合 JSON）でログに記録する方法です。 これにより、ログをテキストではなくデータとして扱うことができ、クエリとフィルタリングが簡単になります。 開発者はプログラムによってログを効率的に保存、取得、分析することができます。 また、デバッグも容易になります。 構造化ログは、ログレベルを通じて異なる環境でのログの詳細度を簡単に変更する方法を提供します。 ログレベルに注意を払ってください。 過度なログ出力はコストを増加させ、アプリケーションのスループットを低下させます。 ログを記録する前に、個人を特定できる情報が編集されていることを確認してください。 以下は、構造化ログの例です： { \"correlationId\": \"9ac54d82-75e0-4f0d-ae3c-e84ca400b3bd\", \"requestId\": \"58d9c96e-ae9f-43db-a353-c48e7a70bfa8\", \"level\": \"INFO\", \"message\": \"AccessDenied\", \"function-name\": \"demo-observability-function\", \"cold-start\": true } トランザクション、異なるコンポーネント間の相関識別子、アプリケーションのビジネス結果に関する運用情報を出力するには、CloudWatch logs への構造化された一元的なログ記録を推奨します。 CloudWatch Logs Insights​ CloudWatch Logs Insights を使用すると、JSON 形式のログのフィールドを自動的に検出できます。 さらに、JSON ログを拡張して、アプリケーション固有のカスタムメタデータをログに記録することができ、これを使用してログの検索、フィルタリング、集計が可能です。 ログの相関 ID​ たとえば、API Gateway から受信した HTTP リクエストの場合、相関 ID は requestContext.requestId パスに設定されており、Lambda Powertools を使用してダウンストリームの Lambda 関数で簡単に抽出してログに記録できます。 分散システムでは、多くの場合、複数のサービスやコンポーネントが連携してリクエストを処理します。 そのため、相関 ID をログに記録し、それをダウンストリームシステムに渡すことは、エンドツーエンドのトレースとデバッグに重要です。 相関 ID は、リクエストの最初の段階で割り当てられる一意の識別子です。 リクエストが異なるサービスを通過する際、相関 ID がログに含まれることで、リクエストの全体的な経路をトレースできます。 AWS Lambda のログに相関 ID を手動で挿入するか、AWS Lambda Powertools のようなツールを使用して、API Gateway から相関 ID を簡単に取得し、アプリケーションログと共に記録することができます。 たとえば、HTTP リクエストの相関 ID は、API Gateway で開始され、Lambda 関数などのバックエンドサービスに渡されるリクエスト ID とすることができます。 Lambda Powertools を使用したコードサンプル​ ベストプラクティスとして、リクエストのライフサイクルの早い段階、できれば API Gateway やアプリケーションロードバランサーなどのサーバーレスアプリケーションのエントリーポイントで、相関 ID を生成します。 分散システム全体でリクエストを追跡するために、UUID やリクエスト ID、その他の一意の属性を使用します。 相関 ID をカスタムヘッダー、ボディ、またはメタデータの一部として、各リクエストと共に渡します。 ダウンストリームサービスのすべてのログエントリとトレースに相関 ID が含まれていることを確認します。 Lambda 関数のログの一部として相関 ID を手動でキャプチャして含めるか、AWS Lambda Powertools のようなツールを使用することができます。 Lambda Powertools を使用すると、サポートされているアップストリームサービスの事前定義されたリクエストパスマッピングから相関 ID を簡単に取得し、アプリケーションログと共に自動的に追加できます。 また、障害が発生した場合に簡単にデバッグし、根本原因を特定して元のリクエストに関連付けられるように、すべてのエラーメッセージに相関 ID が追加されていることを確認してください。 以下のサーバーレスアーキテクチャにおける、相関 ID を使用した構造化ログと CloudWatch での表示方法を示すコードサンプルを見てみましょう： // Initializing Logger Logger log = LogManager.getLogger(); // Uses @Logger annotation from Lambda Powertools, which takes optional parameter correlationIdPath to extract correlation Id from the API Gateway header and inserts correlation_id to the Lambda function logs in a structured format. @Logging(correlationIdPath = \"/headers/path-to-correlation-id\") public APIGatewayProxyResponseEvent handleRequest(final APIGatewayProxyRequestEvent input, final Context context) { ... // The log statement below will also have additional correlation_id log.info(\"Success\") ... } この例では、Java ベースの Lambda 関数が Lambda Powertools ライブラリを使用して、API Gateway リクエストから送られてくる correlation_id をログに記録しています。 コードサンプルの CloudWatch ログの例： { \"level\": \"INFO\", \"message\": \"Success\", \"function-name\": \"demo-observability-function\", \"cold-start\": true, \"lambda_request_id\": \"52fdfc07-2182-154f-163f-5f0f9a621d72\", \"correlation_id\": \"<correlation_id_value>\" }_ CloudWatch Dashboards を使用したログの可視化​ 構造化された JSON 形式でデータをログに記録すると、CloudWatch Logs Insights は JSON 出力の値を自動的に検出し、メッセージをフィールドとして解析します。 CloudWatch Logs Insights は、ログストリームを検索およびフィルタリングするための専用の SQL ライクなクエリ 言語を提供します。 glob や正規表現のパターンマッチングを使用して、複数のロググループに対してクエリを実行できます。 また、カスタムクエリを作成して保存し、毎回作り直すことなく再実行することもできます。 CloudWatch Logs Insights では、1 つ以上の集計関数を使用してクエリから折れ線グラフ、棒グラフ、積み上げ面グラフなどの可視化を生成できます。 これらの可視化を CloudWatch Dashboards に簡単に追加できます。 以下のサンプルダッシュボードは、Lambda 関数の実行時間のパーセンタイルレポートを示しています。 このようなダッシュボードにより、アプリケーションのパフォーマンス改善に注力すべき箇所を素早く把握できます。 平均レイテンシーは重要なメトリクスですが、平均レイテンシーではなく p99 の最適化を目指すべきです。 CloudWatch 以外の場所に（プラットフォーム、関数、拡張機能の）ログを送信するには、Lambda Extensions と Lambda Telemetry API を使用できます。 多くの パートナーソリューション が、Lambda Telemetry API を使用し、システムとの統合を容易にする Lambda レイヤーを提供しています。 CloudWatch Logs Insights を最大限活用するには、構造化ログの形式でどのようなデータをログに取り込むべきかを考え、それによってアプリケーションの健全性をより適切に監視できるようにすることが重要です。 CloudWatch Logs のリテンション​ デフォルトでは、Lambda 関数の標準出力に書き込まれたすべてのメッセージが Amazon CloudWatch のログストリームに保存されます。 Lambda 関数の実行ロールには、CloudWatch ログストリームを作成し、ストリームにログイベントを書き込む権限が必要です。 CloudWatch は取り込まれたデータ量とストレージ使用量に基づいて課金されることを認識しておくことが重要です。 そのため、ログの量を減らすことでコストを最小限に抑えることができます。 デフォルトでは CloudWatch ログは無期限に保持され、有効期限が切れることはありません。ログストレージのコストを削減するために、ログ保持ポリシーを設定することをお勧めします。このポリシーをすべてのロググループに適用してください。 環境ごとに異なる保持ポリシーを設定することもできます。 ログの保持期間は AWS コンソールで手動で設定できますが、一貫性とベストプラクティスを確保するために、Infrastructure as Code (IaC) デプロイメントの一部として設定する必要があります。 以下は、Lambda 関数のログ保持期間を設定する方法を示す CloudFormation テンプレートのサンプルです： Resources: Function: Type: AWS::Serverless::Function Properties: CodeUri: . Runtime: python3.8 Handler: main.handler Tracing: Active # Explicit log group that refers to the Lambda function LogGroup: Type: AWS::Logs::LogGroup Properties: LogGroupName: !Sub \"/aws/lambda/${Function}\" # Explicit retention time RetentionInDays: 7 この例では、Lambda 関数と対応するロググループを作成しています。 RetentionInDays プロパティは 7 日間 に設定されており、このロググループ内のログは 7 日間保持された後、自動的に削除されます。 これにより、ログストレージのコストを管理することができます。 メトリクス​ オブザーバビリティのベストプラクティスガイドのこのセクションでは、以下のトピックについて詳しく説明します： すぐに使えるメトリクスの監視とアラート設定 カスタムメトリクスの発行 埋め込みメトリクスを使用してログからメトリクスを自動生成 CloudWatch Lambda Insights を使用してシステムレベルのメトリクスを監視 CloudWatch アラームの作成 標準メトリクスのモニタリングとアラート設定​ メトリクスは、様々な時間間隔で測定される数値データ（時系列データ）とサービスレベルの指標（リクエストレート、エラーレート、処理時間、CPU など）です。 AWS サービスは、アプリケーションの運用状態を監視するために、多くの標準メトリクスを提供しています。 アプリケーションに適用可能な重要なメトリクスを設定し、それらを使用してアプリケーションのパフォーマンスを監視します。 重要なメトリクスの例として、関数のエラー、キューの深さ、ステートマシンの実行失敗、API レスポンスタイムなどがあります。 標準メトリクスの課題の 1 つは、CloudWatch ダッシュボードでの分析方法を知ることです。 例えば、同時実行数を見る場合、最大値、平均値、またはパーセンタイルのどれを見るべきでしょうか？ また、監視すべき適切な統計値は、メトリクスごとに異なります。 ベストプラクティスとして、Lambda 関数の ConcurrentExecutions メトリクスでは、アカウントおよびリージョンの制限、または該当する場合は Lambda の予約同時実行数の制限に近づいているかを確認するために、Count 統計を確認します。 イベントの処理にかかる時間を示す Duration メトリクスでは、Average または Max 統計を確認します。 API のレイテンシーを測定する場合は、API Gateway の Latency メトリクスの Percentile 統計を確認します。 P50、P90、P99 は、平均値よりもレイテンシーを監視するためのより優れた方法です。 監視すべきメトリクスを把握したら、アプリケーションのコンポーネントが異常な状態になった時に通知するように、これらの重要なメトリクスにアラートを設定します。 例えば： AWS Lambda の場合、Duration、Errors、Throttling、ConcurrentExecutions にアラートを設定します。ストリームベースの呼び出しの場合は IteratorAge に、非同期呼び出しの場合は DeadLetterErrors にアラートを設定します。 Amazon API Gateway の場合、IntegrationLatency、Latency、5XXError、4XXError にアラートを設定します。 Amazon SQS の場合、ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage、ApproximateNumberOfMessageVisible にアラートを設定します。 AWS Step Functions の場合、ExecutionThrottled、ExecutionsFailed、ExecutionsTimedOut にアラートを設定します。 カスタムメトリクスの発行​ アプリケーションのビジネスと顧客の成果に基づいて、重要業績評価指標（KPI）を特定します。 アプリケーションの成功と運用の健全性を評価するために KPI を評価します。 主要なメトリクスはアプリケーションの種類によって異なりますが、サイト訪問数、注文数、航空券購入数、ページ読み込み時間、ユニークビジター数などが例として挙げられます。 AWS CloudWatch にカスタムメトリクスを発行する方法の 1 つは、CloudWatch メトリクス SDK の putMetricData API を呼び出すことです。 しかし、putMetricData API 呼び出しは同期的です。 これにより Lambda 関数の実行時間が長くなり、アプリケーション内の他の API 呼び出しをブロックする可能性があり、パフォーマンスのボトルネックにつながる可能性があります。 また、Lambda 関数の実行時間が長くなると、コストが高くなります。 さらに、CloudWatch に送信されるカスタムメトリクスの数と、実行される API 呼び出し（PutMetricData API 呼び出し）の数の両方に対して課金されます。 カスタムメトリクスを発行するより効率的でコスト効果の高い方法は CloudWatch Embedded Metrics Format（EMF）を使用することです。 CloudWatch Embedded Metrics フォーマットを使用すると、CloudWatch ログに書き込まれたログとして 非同期に カスタムメトリクスを生成でき、より低コストでアプリケーションのパフォーマンスを向上させることができます。 EMF を使用すると、詳細なログイベントデータと共にカスタムメトリクスを埋め込むことができ、CloudWatch は自動的にこれらのカスタムメトリクスを抽出して、標準のメトリクスと同様に可視化やアラームの設定を行うことができます。 埋め込みメトリクスフォーマットでログを送信することで、CloudWatch Logs Insights を使用してクエリを実行でき、メトリクスのコストではなくクエリのコストのみを支払うことになります。 これを実現するには、EMF 仕様 を使用してログを生成し、PutLogEvents API を使用して CloudWatch に送信します。 このプロセスを簡素化するために、EMF フォーマットでメトリクスを作成をサポートする 2 つのクライアントライブラリ があります。 低レベルクライアントライブラリ（aws-embedded-metrics） Lambda Powertools Metrics CloudWatch Lambda Insights を使用してシステムレベルのメトリクスを監視する​ CloudWatch Lambda Insights は、CPU 時間、メモリ使用量、ディスク使用率、ネットワークパフォーマンスなどのシステムレベルのメトリクスを提供します。 また、コールドスタート や Lambda ワーカーのシャットダウンなどの診断情報を収集、集約、要約します。 Lambda Insights は、Lambda レイヤーとしてパッケージ化された CloudWatch Lambda 拡張機能を活用します。 有効化すると、システムレベルのメトリクスを収集し、Lambda 関数の呼び出しごとに 1 つのパフォーマンスログイベントを組み込みメトリクス形式で CloudWatch Logs に出力します。 注記 CloudWatch Lambda Insights はデフォルトでは有効になっておらず、Lambda 関数ごとに有効にする必要があります。 AWS コンソールまたは Infrastructure as Code (IaC) を使用して有効化できます。 以下は、AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) を使用して有効にする例です。 Lambda 関数に LambdaInsightsExtension 拡張レイヤーを追加し、マネージド IAM ポリシー CloudWatchLambdaInsightsExecutionRolePolicy も追加します。 これにより、Lambda 関数にログストリームを作成し、PutLogEvents API を呼び出してログを書き込むための権限が付与されます。 // Add LambdaInsightsExtension Layer to your function resource Resources: MyFunction: Type: AWS::Serverless::Function Properties: Layers: - !Sub \"arn:aws:lambda:${AWS::Region}:580247275435:layer:LambdaInsightsExtension:14\" // Add IAM policy to enable Lambda function to write logs to CloudWatch Resources: MyFunction: Type: AWS::Serverless::Function Properties: Policies: - `CloudWatchLambdaInsightsExecutionRolePolicy` その後、CloudWatch コンソールの Lambda Insights でこれらのシステムレベルのパフォーマンスメトリクスを表示できます。 CloudWatch アラームの作成​ CloudWatch アラームを作成し、メトリクスが閾値を超えた際に必要なアクションを実行することは、オブザーバビリティの重要な部分です。Amazon CloudWatch アラーム は、アプリケーションやインフラストラクチャのメトリクスが静的または動的に設定された閾値を超えた場合に、通知や自動修復アクションを実行するために使用されます。 メトリクスのアラームを設定するには、一連のアクションをトリガーする閾値を選択します。固定の閾値は静的閾値として知られています。例えば、Lambda 関数の Throttles メトリクスに対して、5 分間で 10% を超えた場合にアラームを発生するように設定できます。これは、Lambda 関数がアカウントとリージョンの最大同時実行数に達した可能性があることを示しています。 サーバーレスアプリケーションでは、SNS (Simple Notification Service) を使用してアラートを送信するのが一般的です。これにより、ユーザーはメール、SMS、その他のチャネルを通じてアラートを受信できます。さらに、SNS トピックに Lambda 関数をサブスクライブすることで、アラームを発生させた問題を自動的に修復することができます。 例えば、Lambda 関数 A が SQS キューをポーリングし、下流のサービスを呼び出しているとします。下流のサービスがダウンして応答しない場合、Lambda 関数は SQS からのポーリングを続け、失敗しながら下流のサービスを呼び出し続けます。これらのエラーを監視し、SNS を使用して CloudWatch アラームで適切なチームに通知することもできますが、別の Lambda 関数 B (SNS サブスクリプション経由) を呼び出して、下流のサービスが復旧するまで Lambda 関数 A のイベントソースマッピングを無効にし、SQS キューのポーリングを停止することもできます。 個別のメトリクスにアラームを設定することは良いですが、アプリケーションの運用状態とパフォーマンスをより良く理解するために、複数のメトリクスを監視する必要がある場合があります。このようなシナリオでは、Metric Math 式を使用して複数のメトリクスに基づくアラームを設定する必要があります。 例えば、AWS Lambda のエラーを監視する際に、少数のエラーではアラームを発生させたくない場合、パーセンテージ形式でエラー率の式を作成できます。つまり、ErrorRate = errors / invocation * 100 という式を作成し、設定された評価期間内に ErrorRate が 20% を超えた場合にアラートを送信するアラームを作成できます。 トレーシング​ オブザーバビリティのベストプラクティスガイドのこのセクションでは、以下のトピックについて詳しく説明します： 分散トレーシングと AWS X-Ray の概要 適切なサンプリングルールの適用 X-Ray SDK を使用した他のサービスとの相互作用のトレース X-Ray SDK を使用した統合サービスのトレーシングのコードサンプル 分散トレーシングと AWS X-Ray の概要​ ほとんどのサーバーレスアプリケーションは、複数の AWS サービスを使用する複数のマイクロサービスで構成されています。 サーバーレスアーキテクチャの性質上、分散トレーシングが非常に重要です。 効果的なパフォーマンスモニタリングとエラー追跡のためには、ソース呼び出し元からすべてのダウンストリームサービスまで、アプリケーションフロー全体でトランザクションをトレースすることが重要です。 個々のサービスのログを使用してこれを実現することは可能ですが、AWS X-Ray のようなトレーシングツールを使用する方が迅速で効率的です。 詳細については、Instrumenting your application with AWS X-Ray をご覧ください。 AWS X-Ray を使用すると、マイクロサービスを通過するリクエストをトレースできます。 X-Ray サービスマップを使用すると、異なる統合ポイントを理解し、アプリケーションのパフォーマンス低下を特定できます。 数回のクリックで、アプリケーションのどのコンポーネントがエラー、スロットリング、レイテンシーの問題を引き起こしているかを素早く特定できます。 サービスグラフの下で、個々のトレースを確認して、各マイクロサービスが要した正確な所要時間を特定することもできます。 ベストプラクティスとして、ダウンストリームの呼び出しやモニタリングが必要な特定の機能に対して、コードにカスタムサブセグメントを作成します。 例えば、外部の HTTP API への呼び出しや、SQL データベースクエリのためにサブセグメントを作成できます。 例えば、ダウンストリームサービスを呼び出す関数のカスタムサブセグメントを作成するには、captureAsyncFunc 関数 (node.js の場合) を使用します。 var AWSXRay = require('aws-xray-sdk'); app.use(AWSXRay.express.openSegment('MyApp')); app.get('/', function (req, res) { var host = 'api.example.com'; // start of the subsegment AWSXRay.captureAsyncFunc('send', function(subsegment) { sendRequest(host, function() { console.log('rendering!'); res.render('index'); // end of the subsegment subsegment.close(); }); }); }); この例では、アプリケーションは sendRequest 関数の呼び出しのために send という名前のカスタムサブセグメントを作成します。 captureAsyncFunc は、非同期呼び出しが完了したときにコールバック関数内でクローズする必要があるサブセグメントを渡します。 適切なサンプリングルールを適用する​ AWS X-Ray SDK は、デフォルトではすべてのリクエストをトレースしません。 高コストを発生させることなく、リクエストの代表的なサンプルを提供するために、控えめなサンプリングルールを適用します。 ただし、特定の要件に基づいて、デフォルトのサンプリングルールをカスタマイズしたり、サンプリングを完全に無効にしてすべてのリクエストのトレースを開始したりすることができます。 AWS X-Ray は監査やコンプライアンスツールとして使用することを意図していないことに注意することが重要です。 アプリケーションのタイプごとに異なるサンプリングレート を設定することを検討する必要があります。 たとえば、バックグラウンドポーリングやヘルスチェックなどの大量の読み取り専用呼び出しは、発生する可能性のある問題を特定するのに十分なデータを提供しながら、より低いレートでサンプリングすることができます。 また、環境ごとに異なるサンプリングレート を設定することもできます。 たとえば、開発環境では、エラーやパフォーマンスの問題を簡単にトラブルシューティングできるように、すべてのリクエストをトレースすることができます。 一方、本番環境ではトレース数を少なくすることができます。 広範なトレースはコストの増加につながる可能性があることにも注意 する必要があります。 サンプリングルールの詳細については、X-Ray コンソールでのサンプリングルールの設定を参照してください。 X-Ray SDK を使用して他の AWS サービスとの連携をトレースする​ X-Ray トレースは、AWS Lambda や Amazon API Gateway などのサービスでは、数回のクリックまたは IaC ツールでの数行のコードで簡単に有効化できます。 しかし、他のサービスではコードを計装するために追加の手順が必要です。 X-Ray と統合されている AWS サービスの完全なリストはこちらをご覧ください。 DynamoDB のような X-Ray と統合されていないサービスへの呼び出しを計装するには、AWS SDK の呼び出しを AWS X-Ray SDK でラップしてトレースを取得できます。 例えば、node.js を使用する場合、以下のコード例に従って AWS SDK の呼び出しをすべてキャプチャできます： X-Ray SDK を使用したトレース統合サービスのコードサンプル​ //... FROM (old code) const AWS = require('aws-sdk'); //... TO (new code) const AWSXRay = require('aws-xray-sdk-core'); const AWS = AWSXRay.captureAWS(require('aws-sdk')); ... 注記 個別のクライアントを計測するには、AWS SDK クライアントを AWSXRay.captureAWSClient の呼び出しでラップします。captureAWS と captureAWSClient を一緒に使用しないでください。これにより重複したトレースが発生します。 追加リソース​ CloudWatch Logs Insights CloudWatch Lambda Insights Embedded Metrics Library まとめ​ AWS Lambda ベースのサーバーレスアプリケーションに関するこのオブザーバビリティのベストプラクティスガイドでは、Amazon CloudWatch や AWS X-Ray などのネイティブ AWS サービスを使用したロギング、メトリクス、トレーシングの重要な側面を強調しました。 アプリケーションにオブザーバビリティのベストプラクティスを簡単に追加するために、AWS Lambda Powertools ライブラリの使用を推奨しています。 これらのベストプラクティスを採用することで、サーバーレスアプリケーションに関する貴重な洞察を得ることができ、エラーの迅速な検出とパフォーマンスの最適化が可能になります。 さらに詳しく学ぶには、AWS One Observability Workshop の AWS Native Observability モジュールの実践をお勧めします。 このページを編集 前へ

Format このページの見出し CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format はじめに​ CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF) を使用すると、お客様は複雑な高カーディナリティのアプリケーションデータをログの形式で Amazon CloudWatch に取り込み、実用的なメトリクスを生成できます。 Embedded Metric Format を使用することで、お客様は環境に関する洞察を得るために、複雑なアーキテクチャやサードパーティツールに頼る必要がなくなります。 この機能はすべての環境で使用できますが、AWS Lambda 関数や Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)、Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)、EC2 上の Kubernetes などの一時的なリソースを持つワークロードで特に有用です。 Embedded Metric Format を使用すると、個別のコードを実装したり保守したりすることなく、カスタムメトリクスを簡単に作成でき、ログデータに対する強力な分析機能を得ることができます。 Embedded Metric Format (EMF) ログの仕組み​ Amazon EC2、オンプレミスサーバー、Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)、Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)、EC2 上の Kubernetes などのコンピューティング環境では、CloudWatch エージェントを通じて Embedded Metric Format (EMF) ログを生成し、Amazon CloudWatch に送信できます。 AWS Lambda では、カスタムコードを必要とせず、ブロッキングネットワーク呼び出しを行わず、サードパーティのソフトウェアに依存することなく、Embedded Metric Format (EMF) ログを Amazon CloudWatch に生成および取り込むことができます。 EMF 仕様 に準拠した構造化ログを公開する際に、特別なヘッダー宣言を必要とせず、詳細なログイベントデータと共にカスタムメトリクスを非同期で埋め込むことができます。CloudWatch は自動的にカスタムメトリクスを抽出するため、リアルタイムのインシデント検出のための可視化とアラームの設定が可能です。抽出されたメトリクスに関連する詳細なログイベントと高カーディナリティのコンテキストは、CloudWatch Logs Insights を使用してクエリを実行し、運用イベントの根本原因に関する深い洞察を得ることができます。 Fluent Bit 用の Amazon CloudWatch 出力プラグインを使用すると、Embedded Metric Format (EMF) のサポートを含む Amazon CloudWatch サービスにメトリクスとログデータを取り込むことができます。 Embedded Metric Format (EMF) ログを使用するタイミング​ 従来、モニタリングは 3 つのカテゴリに分類されてきました。 第 1 のカテゴリは、アプリケーションの従来型のヘルスチェックです。 第 2 のカテゴリは「メトリクス」で、カウンター、タイマー、ゲージなどのモデルを使用してアプリケーションを計測します。 第 3 のカテゴリは「ログ」で、アプリケーションの全体的なオブザーバビリティに不可欠です。 ログは、アプリケーションの動作状況に関する継続的な情報を提供します。 現在、お客様は Embedded Metric Format (EMF) ログを通じて、データの粒度や豊富さを犠牲にすることなく、アプリケーションのすべての計測を統合・簡素化しながら、優れた分析機能を獲得することで、アプリケーションの監視方法を大幅に改善できるようになりました。 Embedded Metric Format (EMF) ログ は、カーディナリティの高いアプリケーションデータを生成する環境に最適です。 メトリクスのディメンションを増やすことなく、EMF ログの一部としてデータを含めることができます。 これにより、すべての属性をメトリクスのディメンションとして設定する必要なく、CloudWatch Logs Insights や CloudWatch Metrics Insights を通じて EMF ログをクエリすることで、アプリケーションデータを様々な角度から分析できます。 数百万台の通信機器や IoT デバイスからテレメトリデータを集約するお客様は、デバイスのパフォーマンスに関する洞察と、デバイスが報告する固有のテレメトリを迅速に詳しく調査する能力を必要としています。 また、質の高いサービスを提供するために、膨大なデータを掘り下げることなく、より簡単かつ迅速に問題を解決する必要があります。 Embedded Metric Format (EMF) ログを使用することで、お客様はメトリクスとログを単一のエンティティに結合して大規模なオブザーバビリティを実現し、コスト効率とパフォーマンスを向上させながらトラブルシューティングを改善できます。 Embedded Metric Format (EMF) ログの生成​ EMF ログを生成するには、以下の方法を使用できます。 オープンソースのクライアントライブラリを使用して、エージェント (CloudWatch、Fluent-Bit、Firelens など) を通じて EMF ログを生成し送信します。 EMF ログを作成するために使用できるオープンソースのクライアントライブラリは、以下の言語で利用可能です。 Node.Js Python Java C# AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) を使用して EMF ログを生成できます。ADOT は、Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) の一部である OpenTelemetry プロジェクトの、セキュアで本番環境対応の AWS がサポートするディストリビューションです。OpenTelemetry は、アプリケーションモニタリングのための分散トレース、ログ、メトリクスを収集する API、ライブラリ、エージェントを提供し、ベンダー固有のフォーマット間の境界と制限を取り除くオープンソースイニシアチブです。これには、OpenTelemetry 準拠のデータソースと、CloudWatch EMF ログで使用できるように設定された ADOT Collector の 2 つのコンポーネントが必要です。 定義された JSON 形式の仕様 に準拠する手動で構築されたログは、CloudWatch エージェント または PutLogEvents API を通じて CloudWatch に送信できます。 CloudWatch コンソールでの Embedded Metric Format ログの表示​ Embedded Metric Format (EMF) ログからメトリクスを抽出した後、お客様は CloudWatch コンソールでメトリクスを表示 することができます。 組み込みメトリクスには、ログ生成時に指定されたディメンションがあります。 クライアントライブラリを使用して生成された組み込みメトリクスには、デフォルトのディメンションとして ServiceType、ServiceName、LogGroup があります。 ServiceName: サービス名は上書きされますが、サービス名を推測できない場合 (EC2 で実行される Java プロセスなど)、明示的に設定されていない場合はデフォルト値として Unknown が使用されます。 ServiceType: サービスタイプは上書きされますが、タイプを推測できない場合 (EC2 で実行される Java プロセスなど)、明示的に設定されていない場合はデフォルト値として Unknown が使用されます。 LogGroupName: エージェントベースのプラットフォームでは、お客様はメトリクスを配信する先のロググループを任意で設定できます。この値は、ライブラリから Embedded Metric ペイロードでエージェントに渡されます。LogGroup が指定されていない場合、デフォルト値はサービス名から派生した -metrics となります。 LogStreamName: エージェントベースのプラットフォームでは、お客様はメトリクスを配信する先のログストリームを任意で設定できます。この値は、ライブラリから Embedded Metric ペイロードでエージェントに渡されます。LogStreamName が指定されていない場合、デフォルト値はエージェントによって派生されます (通常はホスト名)。 NameSpace: CloudWatch の名前空間を上書きします。設定されていない場合、デフォルト値として aws-embedded-metrics が使用されます。 CloudWatch コンソールログでの EMF ログのサンプルは以下のようになります。 2023-05-19T15:20:39.391Z 238196b6-c8da-4341-a4b7-0c322e0ef5bb INFO { \"LogGroup\":

を使用して、抽出されたメトリクスに関連する詳細なログイベントを照会し、運用イベントの根本原因について深い洞察を得ることができます。 EMF ログからメトリクスを抽出することの利点の 1 つは、お客様が一意のメトリクス (メトリクス名と一意のディメンションセット) とメトリクス値でログをフィルタリングし、集計されたメトリクス値に寄与したイベントのコンテキストを取得できることです。 上記で説明した EMF ログについて、ProcessingLatency をメトリクスとし、Service をディメンションとして影響を受けたリクエスト ID やデバイス ID を取得する例を、CloudWatch Logs Insights のサンプルクエリとして以下に示します。 filter ProcessingLatency < 200 and Service = \"Aggregator\" | fields @requestId, @ingestionTime, @DeviceId EMF ログで作成されたメトリクスのアラーム​ EMF で生成されたメトリクスのアラーム の作成は、他のメトリクスのアラーム作成と同じパターンに従います。 ここで注意すべき重要なポイントは、EMF メトリクスの生成はログの公開フローに依存しているということです。これは、CloudWatch Logs が EMF ログを処理してメトリクスに変換するためです。 そのため、アラームが評価される期間内にメトリクスのデータポイントが作成されるように、タイムリーにログを公開することが重要です。 上記で説明した EMF ログについて、ProcessingLatency メトリクスをデータポイントとして使用し、しきい値を設定したアラームの例を以下に示します。 EMF ログの最新機能​ お客様は PutLogEvents API を使用して EMF ログを CloudWatch Logs に送信できます。メトリクスを抽出するように CloudWatch Logs に指示するための HTTP ヘッダー x-amzn-logs-format: json/emf を含めることもできますが、これは必須ではなくなりました。 Amazon CloudWatch は、Embedded Metric Format (EMF) を使用した構造化ログから、最大 1 秒の粒度での高解像度メトリクス抽出をサポートしています。お客様は EMF 仕様のログ内でオプションの StorageResolution パラメータを、1 または 60 (デフォルト) の値で指定することで、メトリクスの希望する解像度 (秒単位) を示すことができます。EMF を通じて標準解像度 (60 秒) と高解像度 (1 秒) の両方のメトリクスを公開でき、アプリケーションの健全性とパフォーマンスをきめ細かく可視化できます。 Amazon CloudWatch は、2 つのエラーメトリクス (EMFValidationErrors と EMFParsingErrors) を使用して、Embedded Metric Format (EMF) のエラーの可視性を強化しています。この強化された可視性により、お客様は EMF を活用する際のエラーを素早く特定して修正できるため、計装プロセスが簡素化されます。 最新のアプリケーション管理の複雑さが増す中、お客様はカスタムメトリクスの定義と分析においてより柔軟性を必要としています。そのため、メトリクスディメンションの最大数が 10 から 30 に増加されました。お客様は最大 30 のディメンションを持つ EMF ログを使用してカスタムメトリクスを作成できます。

このページの見出し AWS Rust SDK を使用したカスタムメトリクスの作成 はじめに​ Rust は、安全性、パフォーマンス、並行処理に重点を置いたシステムプログラミング言語で、ソフトウェア開発の世界で人気を集めています。 メモリ管理とスレッドの安全性に対するユニークなアプローチにより、堅牢で効率的なアプリケーションの構築に適しており、特にクラウドでの利用に適しています。 サーバーレスアーキテクチャの台頭と、高性能でスケーラブルなサービスへのニーズの高まりにより、Rust の機能はクラウドネイティブアプリケーションの構築に最適な選択肢となっています。 このガイドでは、AWS Rust SDK を活用してカスタム CloudWatch メトリクスを作成し、AWS エコシステム内でアプリケーションのパフォーマンスと動作についてより深い洞察を得る方法を探ります。 前提条件​ このガイドを使用するには、Rust をインストールし、後で使用するデータを保存するための CloudWatch ロググループとログストリームを作成する必要があります。 Rust のインストール​ Mac または Linux の場合: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh Windows の場合は、rustup-init.exe をダウンロードして実行してください。 CloudWatch ロググループとログストリームの作成​ CloudWatch ロググループを作成します: aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name rust_custom CloudWatch ログストリームを作成します: aws logs create-log-stream --log-group-name rust_custom --log-stream-name diceroll_log_stream コード​ 完全なコードは、このリポジトリの sandbox セクションにあります。 git clone https://github.com/aws-observability/observability-best-practices.git cd observability-best-practices/sandbox/rust-custom-metrics このコードではまず、サイコロを振るシミュレーションを行います。このサイコロの値をカスタムメトリクスとして扱います。 そして、このメトリクスを CloudWatch に追加し、ダッシュボードで表示する 3 つの異なる方法を紹介します。 アプリケーションのセットアップ​ まず、アプリケーションで使用するクレートをインポートする必要があります。 use crate::cloudwatch::types::Dimension; use crate::cloudwatchlogs::types::InputLogEvent; use aws_sdk_cloudwatch as cloudwatch; use aws_sdk_cloudwatch::config::BehaviorVersion; use aws_sdk_cloudwatch::types::MetricDatum; use aws_sdk_cloudwatchlogs as cloudwatchlogs; use rand::prelude::*; use serde::Serialize; use serde_json::json; use std::time::{SystemTime, UNIX_EPOCH}; このインポートブロックでは、主に使用する AWS SDK ライブラリをインポートしています。 また、ランダムなサイコロの値を生成するために 'rand' クレートも導入しています。 最後に、SDK 呼び出しで使用するデータ作成を処理するために、'serde' や 'time' などのライブラリも導入しています。 次に、main 関数でサイコロの値を作成できます。この値は、実行する 3 つの AWS SDK 呼び出しすべてで使用されます。 //select a random number 1-6 to represent a diceroll let mut rng = rand::thread_rng(); let roll_value = rng.gen_range(1..7); サイコロの数値が得られたので、この値を CloudWatch にカスタムメトリクスとして追加する 3 つの異なる方法を見ていきましょう。 値がカスタムメトリクスになると、その値にアラームを設定したり、異常検出を設定したり、ダッシュボードにプロットしたりなど、さまざまなことができるようになります。 Put Metric Data​ 最初に使用するメトリクスを CloudWatch に追加する方法は PutMetricData です。PutMetricData を使用すると、メトリクスの時系列の値を CloudWatch に直接書き込むことができます。これが値を追加する最も効率的な方法です。PutMetricData を使用する場合、メトリクス値と共に名前空間とディメンションを各 AWS SDK 呼び出しに提供する必要があります。以下がそのコードです： まず、メトリクス（サイコロの値）を受け取り、Result 型を返す関数を設定します。Rust では Result 型は成功または失敗を示します。関数内で最初に行うのは、AWS Rust SDK クライアントの初期化です。クライアントはローカル環境から認証情報とリージョンを継承します。このコードを実行する前に、コマンドラインから aws configure を実行して、これらが設定されていることを確認してください。 async fn put_metric_data(roll_value: i32) -> Result<(), cloudwatch::Error> { //Create a reusable aws config that we can pass to our clients let config = aws_config::load_defaults(BehaviorVersion::v2023_11_09()).await; //Create a cloudwatch client let client = cloudwatch::Client::new(&config); クライアントの初期化後、PutMetricData API 呼び出しに必要な入力の設定を開始できます。ディメンションを定義し、その後、ディメンションと値の組み合わせである MetricDatum 自体を定義する必要があります。 //Use fluent builders to build the required input for pmd call, starting with dimensions. let dimensions = Dimension::builder() .name(\"roll_value_pmd_dimension\") .value(roll_value.to_string()) .build(); let put_metric_data_input = MetricDatum::builder() .metric_name(\"roll_value_pmd\") .dimensions(dimensions) .value(f64::from(roll_value)) .build(); 最後に、先ほど定義した入力を使用して PutMetricData API を呼び出すことができます。 let response = client .put_metric_data() .namespace(\"rust_custom_metrics\") .metric_data(put_metric_data_input) .send() .await?; println!(\"Metric Submitted: {:?}\", response); Ok(()) SDK の呼び出しが非同期関数内にあることに注意してください。関数は非同期で完了するため、完了を await する必要があります。その後、関数の最上位で定義された Result 型を返します。 main から関数を呼び出す時は、以下のようになります： //call the put_metric_data function with the roll value println!(\"First we will write a custom metric with PutMetricData API call\"); put_metric_data(roll_value).await.unwrap(); ここでも関数呼び出しの完了を待ち、値を unwrap します。この場合、エラーではなく 'Ok' の結果にのみ興味があるためです。本番環境のシナリオでは、おそらく異なる方法でエラー処理を行うことになるでしょう。 PutLogEvent + メトリクスフィルター​ カスタムメトリクスを作成する次の方法は、CloudWatch ロググループに直接書き込むことです。メトリクスが CloudWatch ロググループに書き込まれたら、メトリクスフィルター を使用してログデータからメトリクスデータを抽出できます。 まず、ログメッセージ用の構造体を定義します。これは任意の手順で、手動で JSON を構築することもできます。しかし、より複雑なアプリケーションでは、再利用性のためにこのようなログ構造体が必要になるでしょう。 //ログメッセージ用のシンプルな構造体を作成します。手動で JSON 文字列を作成することもできます。 #[derive(Serialize)] struct DicerollValue { welcome_message: String, roll_value: i32, } 構造体を定義したら、AWS API の呼び出しを行う準備が整います。今回も API クライアントを作成しますが、今回は logs SDK を使用します。また、Unix エポックタイミングを使用してシステム時刻を定義します。 //Create a reusable aws config that we can pass to our clients let config = aws_config::load_defaults(BehaviorVersion::v2023_11_09()).await; //Create a cloudwatch logs client let client = cloudwatchlogs::Client::new(&config); //Let's get the time in ms from unix epoch, this is required for CWlogs let time_now = SystemTime::now() .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH) .unwrap() .as_millis() as i64; まず、先ほど定義した構造体の新しいインスタンスから JSON を作成します。次に、これを使用してログイベントを作成します。 let log_json = json!(DicerollValue { welcome_message: String::from(\"Hello from rust!\"), roll_value }); let log_event = InputLogEvent::builder() .timestamp(time_now) .message(log_json.to_string()) .build(); これで、PutMetricData で行ったのと同様の方法で API 呼び出しを完了できます。 let response = client .put_log_events() .log_group_name(\"rust_custom\") .log_stream_name(\"diceroll_log_stream\") .log_events(log_event.unwrap()) .send() .await?; println!(\"Log event submitted: {:?}\", response); Ok(()) ログイベントが送信されたら、CloudWatch に移動し、メトリクスを適切に抽出するためにロググループのメトリクスフィルターを作成する必要があります。 CloudWatch コンソールで、作成した rust_custom ロググループに移動します。次に、メトリクスフィルターを作成します。フィルターパターンは {$.roll_value = *} とします。次に、メトリクス値として $.roll_value を使用します。任意の名前空間とメトリクス名を使用できます。このメトリクスフィルターは次のように説明できます： 「値に関係なく、'roll_value' というフィールドを受け取るたびにフィルターをトリガーします。トリガーされると、'roll_value' を CloudWatch メトリクスに書き込む数値として使用します」。 このメトリクス作成方法は、ログフォーマットを制御できない場合に、ログデータから時系列の値を抽出するのに非常に強力です。私たちはコードを直接計装しているため、ログデータのフォーマットを制御できます。したがって、次のステップで説明する CloudWatch 組み込みメトリクスフォーマットを使用する方が良い方法かもしれません。 PutLogEvent + Embedded Metric Format​ CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format(EMF) は、時系列メトリクスをログに直接埋め込む方法です。 CloudWatch は、メトリクスフィルターを使用せずにメトリクスを抽出できます。 コードを見てみましょう。 ログクライアントを再度作成し、Unix エポックでシステム時刻を取得します。 //Create a reusable aws config that we can pass to our clients let config = aws_config::load_defaults(BehaviorVersion::v2023_11_09()).await; //Create a cloudwatch logs client let client = cloudwatchlogs::Client::new(&config); //get the time in unix epoch ms let time_now = SystemTime::now() .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH) .unwrap() .as_millis() as i64; 次に、EMF の JSON 文字列を作成できます。 CloudWatch がカスタムメトリクスを作成するために必要なすべてのデータを含める必要があるため、名前空間、ディメンション、値を文字列に埋め込みます。 //Create a json string in embedded metric format with our diceroll value. let json_emf = json!( { \"_aws\": { \"Timestamp\": time_now, \"CloudWatchMetrics\": [ { \"Namespace\": \"rust_custom_metrics\", \"Dimensions\": [[\"roll_value_emf_dimension\"]], \"Metrics\": [ { \"Name\": \"roll_value_emf\" } ] } ] }, \"roll_value_emf_dimension\": roll_value.to_string(), \"roll_value_emf\": roll_value } ); ロール値を値として使用するだけでなく、ディメンションとしても作成していることに注目してください。 これにより、ロール値で GroupBy を実行でき、各ロール値が何回出現したかを確認できます。 以前と同じように、API を呼び出してログイベントを書き込むことができます： let log_event = InputLogEvent::builder() .timestamp(time_now) .message(json_emf.to_string()) .build(); let response = client .put_log_events() .log_group_name(\"rust_custom\") .log_stream_name(\"diceroll_log_stream_emf\") .log_events(log_event.unwrap()) .send() .await?; println!(\"EMF Log event submitted: {:?}\", response); Ok(()) ログイベントが CloudWatch に送信されると、メトリクスフィルターを使用せずにメトリクスが抽出されます。 これは、すべてのディメンションで PutMetricData API を呼び出すよりも、ログメッセージとしてこれらの値を書き込む方が簡単な、高カーディナリティメトリクスを作成する優れた方法です。 すべてをまとめる​ 最終的な main 関数は、以下のように 3 つの API 呼び出しを行います。 #[::tokio::main] async fn main() { println!(\"Let's have some fun by creating custom metrics with the Rust SDK\"); //select a random number 1-6 to represent a dicerolll let mut rng = rand::thread_rng(); let roll_value = rng.gen_range(1..7); //call the put_metric_data function with the roll value println!(\"First we will write a custom metric with PutMetricData API call\"); put_metric_data(roll_value).await.unwrap(); println!(\"Now let's write a log event, which we will then extract a custom metric from.\"); //call the put_log_data function with the roll value put_log_event(roll_value).await.unwrap(); //call the put_log_emf function with the roll value println!(\"Now we will put a log event with embedded metric format to directly submit the custom metric.\"); put_log_event_emf(roll_value).await.unwrap(); } テストデータを生成するために、アプリケーションをビルドし、ループで実行して CloudWatch で表示するデータを生成します。 ルートディレクトリから以下のコマンドを実行します。 cargo build 次に、2 秒のスリープを入れて 50 回実行します。 このスリープは、CloudWatch ダッシュボードでメトリクスを見やすくするために、メトリクスの間隔を少し空けるためのものです。 for run in {1..50}; do ./target/debug/custom-metrics; sleep 2; done これで CloudWatch で結果を確認できます。 私はディメンションで GroupBy を行うのが好みです。これにより、各ロール値が選択された回数を確認できます。 Metric Insights のクエリは以下のようになります。 メトリクス名とディメンション名は、変更した場合はそれに応じて変更してください。 SELECT COUNT(roll_value_emf) FROM rust_custom_metrics GROUP BY roll_value_emf_dimension これで 3 つすべてをダッシュボードに配置し、予想通り同じグラフが表示されることを確認できます。 クリーンアップ​ rust_custom ロググループを必ず削除してください。 aws logs delete-log-group --log-group-name rust_custom このページを編集 前へ key-performance-indicators 次へ Amazon Managed

ベースのサーバーレスアプリケーションのオブザーバビリティを設定するベストプラクティスを説明します。 AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT)、AWS X-Ray、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) などのツールと、これらのツールを使用してサーバーレスアプリケーションに関する実用的なインサイトを得る方法、問題のトラブルシューティング方法、アプリケーションパフォーマンスの最適化方法について説明します。 主要なトピック​ オブザーバビリティのベストプラクティスガイドのこのセクションでは、以下のトピックについて詳しく説明します： AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) と ADOT Lambda Layer の概要 ADOT Lambda Layer を使用した Lambda 関数の自動計装 ADOT Collector のカスタム設定サポート Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP) との統合 ADOT Lambda Layer 使用のメリットとデメリット ADOT 使用時のコールドスタートレイテンシーの管理 AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) の概要​ AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) は、Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) の OpenTelemetry (OTel) プロジェクトの、セキュアで本番環境に対応した AWS がサポートするディストリビューションです。 ADOT を使用すると、アプリケーションを一度計装するだけで、相関のあるメトリクスとトレースを複数の監視ソリューションに送信できます。 AWS のマネージド型 OpenTelemetry Lambda Layer は、OpenTelemetry Lambda Layer を使用してテレメトリデータをエクスポートします。 AWS Lambda 関数をラップし、OpenTelemetry ランタイム固有の SDK、軽量化された ADOT コレクター、AWS Lambda 関数の自動計装用の設定をパッケージ化することで、プラグアンドプレイのユーザーエクスペリエンスを提供します。 ADOT Lambda Layer のコレクターコンポーネント (Receivers、Exporters、Extensions など) は、Amazon CloudWatch、Amazon OpenSearch Service、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus、AWS X-Ray などとの統合をサポートしています。 完全なリストはこちらでご確認ください。 また、ADOT はパートナーソリューションとの統合もサポートしています。 ADOT Lambda Layer は、自動計装 (Python、NodeJS、Java 向け) と、特定のライブラリや SDK 向けのカスタム計装の両方をサポートしています。 自動計装では、デフォルトで Lambda Layer は AWS X-Ray にトレースをエクスポートするように設定されています。 カスタム計装の場合は、対応する OpenTelemetry ランタイム計装リポジトリ からライブラリ計装を含め、関数内で初期化するようにコードを変更する必要があります。 AWS Lambda での ADOT Lambda Layer を使用した自動計装​ ADOT Lambda Layer を使用することで、コードを変更することなく Lambda 関数の自動計装を簡単に有効にできます。既存の Java ベースの Lambda 関数に ADOT Lambda Layer を追加し、CloudWatch で実行ログとトレースを表示する例を見てみましょう。 ドキュメント に従って、runtime、region、arch type に基づいて Lambda Layer の ARN を選択します。Lambda Layer は Lambda 関数と同じリージョンで使用してください。例えば、Java の自動計装用の Lambda Layer は arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:901920570463:layer:aws-otel-java-agent-x86_64-ver-1-28-1:1 となります。 コンソールまたは任意の IaC を使用して、Lambda 関数にレイヤーを追加します。 AWS コンソールの場合は、手順 に従って Lambda 関数にレイヤーを追加します。「Specify an ARN」で上記で選択したレイヤー ARN を貼り付けます。 IaC オプションの場合、Lambda 関数の SAM テンプレートは次のようになります： Layers: - !Sub arn:aws:lambda:${AWS::Region}:901920570463:layer:aws-otel-java-agent-arm64-ver-1-28-1:1 Lambda 関数に環境変数を追加します。Node.js または Java の場合は AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER=/opt/otel-handler、Python の場合は AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER=/opt/otel-instrument を追加します。 Lambda 関数のアクティブトレースを有効にします。注意 デフォルトでは、レイヤーは AWS X-Ray にトレースをエクスポートするように設定されています。Lambda 関数の実行ロールに必要な AWS X-Ray 権限があることを確認してください。AWS Lambda の AWS X-Ray 権限について詳しくは、AWS Lambda のドキュメント を参照してください。 Tracing: Active Lambda Layer の設定、環境変数、X-Ray トレースを含む SAM テンプレートの例は次のようになります： Resources: ListBucketsFunction: Type: AWS::Serverless::Function Properties:

Environment: Variables: OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR_CONFIG_FILE: /var/task/collector.yaml OpenTelemetry Metrics API を使用してメトリクスを追加するように Lambda 関数コードを更新します。以下の例を参照してください。 // get meter Meter meter = GlobalOpenTelemetry.getMeterProvider() .meterBuilder(\"aws-otel\") .setInstrumentationVersion(\"1.0\") .build(); // Build counter e.g. LongCounter LongCounter counter = meter .counterBuilder(\"processed_jobs\") .setDescription(\"Processed jobs\") .setUnit(\"1\") .build(); // It is recommended that the API user keep a reference to Attributes they will record against Attributes attributes = Attributes.of(stringKey(\"Key\"), \"SomeWork\"); // Record data counter.add(123, attributes); ADOT Lambda Layer 使用のメリットとデメリット​ Lambda 関数から AWS X-Ray にトレースを送信する場合、X-Ray SDK または AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) Lambda Layer のいずれかを使用できます。 X-Ray SDK は様々な AWS サービスの計装を容易にしますが、トレースを X-Ray にのみ送信できます。 一方、Lambda Layer の一部として含まれる ADOT コレクターは、各言語に対して多数のライブラリ計装をサポートしています。 これを使用して、メトリクスとトレースを収集し、AWS X-Ray や Amazon CloudWatch、Amazon OpenSearch Service、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus、その他のパートナーソリューションに送信できます。 ただし、ADOT が提供する柔軟性により、Lambda 関数には追加のメモリが必要となり、コールドスタートのレイテンシーに大きな影響を与える可能性があります。 そのため、低レイテンシーを重視し、OpenTelemetry の高度な機能が不要な場合は、ADOT よりも AWS X-Ray SDK の使用がより適切かもしれません。 詳細な比較と適切なトレースツールの選択に関するガイダンスについては、ADOT と X-Ray SDK の選択に関する AWS ドキュメントを参照してください。 ADOT 使用時のコールドスタートレイテンシーの管理​ Java 用の ADOT Lambda Layer はエージェントベースです。つまり、自動計装を有効にすると、Java Agent は OTel のサポート対象ライブラリすべてを計装しようとします。これにより、Lambda

向け ADOT Collector の設計​ ADOT Collector は、以下の 3 つの主要コンポーネントで構成されるパイプラインアーキテクチャを使用します： Receivers：指定された形式でデータを受け入れ、内部形式に変換します。 Processors：データのバッチ処理、フィルタリング、変換などのタスクを実行します。 Exporters：メトリクス、ログ、トレースの送信先を決定します。 EKS Fargate では、ADOT Collector は Prometheus Receiver を使用して、ワーカーノード上の kubelet のプロキシとして機能する Kubernetes API サーバーからメトリクスをスクレイピングします。 これは、kubelet への直接アクセスを妨げる EKS Fargate のネットワーク制限により必要なアプローチです。 収集されたメトリクスは、フィルタリング、名前の変更、データの集約、変換のための一連の Processors を通過します。 最後に、AWS CloudWatch EMF Exporter がメトリクスを埋め込みメトリクス形式 (EMF) に変換し、CloudWatch Logs に送信します。 図 1：EKS Fargate 上の ADOT

オブザーバビリティは、開発者の生産性を向上させ、アプリケーションのパフォーマンスを改善し、より良い意思決定と迅速な問題解決によってビジネスの成功を促進するため、開発者にとって非常に重要です。 このガイドでは、オブザーバビリティを効果的に活用するためのベストプラクティスと推奨事項を提供します。 開発者にとってオブザーバビリティが重要な理由​ 開発者は以下の主要な目的でオブザーバビリティを使用します： 迅速な問題の特定と解決： オブザーバビリティにより、開発者は問題を素早く特定して診断でき、問題解決までの時間 (MTTR) を短縮し、ソフトウェアデリバリーのパフォーマンスを全体的に向上させることができます 本番環境でのシステムの動作を理解し、十分な情報に基づいた意思決定と運用改善を可能にします 顧客体験の向上： システムの動作を分析することで、パフォーマンスと信頼性を最適化し、より良い顧客体験とユーザー満足度の向上につながります オブザーバビリティツールを使用してユーザーの操作を監視し、UI/UX の問題を迅速に特定して対処できます チームの効率性とイノベーションの向上： オブザーバビリティプラットフォームは運用データの単一の情報源を提供し、チーム間のコラボレーションを促進し、トラブルシューティングの時間を短縮します 自動化されたインサイトとアラートにより、開発者は手動でのデバッグに費やす時間を減らし、イノベーションにより多くの時間を費やすことができます データに基づく意思決定： オブザーバビリティはシステムパフォーマンスに関する詳細なインサイトを提供し、コードの改善やリソース割り当てに関するデータ駆動の意思決定を可能にします 改善が必要な領域を特定することで、組織の投資を最適化し、市場投入までの時間を短縮できます 複雑性の管理： オブザーバビリティは、システムの相互依存関係を包括的に可視化することで、最新のクラウドネイティブおよびマルチクラウド環境の複雑性を管理するのに役立ちます 複雑性を整理し、関連するデータに焦点を当てることで、より効率的な開発プロセスを促進します コード品質のベストプラクティス​ 課題追跡メトリクスのモニタリング: JIRA や Trello などの課題追跡プラットフォームを使用して、以下のようなメトリクスを追跡します: チケットがコードレビューからテストレビューに移動し、進行中に戻る回数。高い数値は、スキル不足、高い複雑性、または不適切なツールの使用を示す可能性があります。 チケットが外部依存関係によってブロックされる回数。高い数値は、依存関係間の高い結合度や高い複雑性を示す可能性があります。 推奨事項: Amazon Q Developer のようなツールを使用して、自動コードレビューで生産性とコード品質を向上させます。Amazon Q Developer は、ソフトウェア開発タスクの速度を最大 80% 向上させ、急速な開発サイクル中のヒューマンエラーの可能性を減らすことでコード品質の向上に貢献します。 改善点を特定し、継続的な改善の考え方を育むために、レトロスペクティブの一環としてメトリクスの定期的なレビューをスケジュールします。 パフォーマンスメトリクス用のコード計装: コードの実装のパフォーマンス効率とスケーラビリティを評価することで、コード品質の間接的な測定を可能にするために、以下を測定できるようにコードを計装します。 RED メソッド: マイクロサービスのリクエスト、エラー、所要時間をモニタリングします。これにより、サービスのパフォーマンスと信頼性に関する洞察が得られます。 USE メソッド: システムリソースの使用率、飽和度、エラーを追跡します。これにより、ボトルネックとリソースの制約を特定できます。 他のサービス、データベース、キャッシュなど、リクエスト処理パスにおけるすべての外部依存関係への呼び出しの周りに計装を追加します。これにより、リクエスト処理時間の突然の変化を調査するために必要な情報を提供し、問題の根本原因をより迅速に特定できます。 推奨事項: リクエストのレイテンシーとエラー率に SLO (Service Level Objective) を設定し、それを使用してより良い品質とパフォーマンスのための改善を推進します。 重要なデータフローとリクエスト処理パスを実行する自動テストに計装の検証を追加します。 システムパフォーマンスとコード品質測定のベースラインを作成する自動負荷テストタスクを構築します。 単一のリクエストのパフォーマンスへの影響を特定できるように、計装に文脈を追加します。 計装の追加に関連する手動作業を減らすために、SDK が提供する自動計装を設定して活用します。 効率的なロギングとモニタリング​ json などの構造化されたログフォーマットを使用します。既存のアプリケーションでは、ログ変換機能を使用してより多くのコンテキストを注入し、フィールドを追加または削除することを検討してください。 意味のあるシグナルを導き出し、シグナル間で相関関係を取れるように、十分なメタデータを含む広範なイベントフォーマットを使用します。 OpenTelemetry または ADOT SDK を使用して、シグナル間の相関関係を可能にし、問題特定時間 (MTTI) を短縮し、結果として復旧時間 (MTTR) を短縮するための追加コンテキストをログに注入します。 ログレベルを適切に使用します - これによりログの量を制御し、取り込みのコストを抑えることができます。 ERROR は、予期しない、および予期される全てのエラー状態に使用します。根本原因分析を加速できるように、できるだけ多くの追加コンテキストを加えます。 INFO は、ユーザーログインなどの一般的な実行時イベントに使用します。これらはコンテキストを提供し、重要です。 DEBUG は、アプリケーションのフローと状態をより深く理解するために、処理パス内の呼び出しをログに記録するために使用します。 PII や PHI などの機密性の高いデータのログ記録は避けます。要件がある場合は、データ保護ポリシーの使用や、取り込み時のデータの編集を検討してください。IAM ポリシーを使用して、生データを閲覧できる人を制御します。 埋め込みメトリクスフォーマット (EMF) を使用してログ内にメトリクスを埋め込み、オブザーバビリティプラットフォームへの API 呼び出し回数を減らし、コストを削減します。 requestId などのカーディナリティの高いディメンションを持つメトリクスには EMF を使用しないでください。 アラート: 異常検出を使用して、アラートの厳格なしきい値設定を避けます。これにより、システムの使用状況が時間とともに変化した場合のしきい値更新のオーバーヘッドを避け、アラートノイズを減らすことができます。 Metric Math と組み合わせアラートを使用して、特定の障害に対して生成される個々のアラートの数を減らします。 SLO が危険にさらされているか、失敗している場合にのみアラートを発生させます。これにより、チームが不必要に起こされることを避け、認知的およびコンテキストの過負荷を減らすことができます。 障害通知に対してアクションを取れる人がいる場合にのみアラートを発生させます。 可能な場合はアラートの解決を自動化します。例えば、オートスケーリング、レプリカやスタンバイインスタンスへの自動フェイルオーバーなど、ネイティブのプラットフォーム設定を活用します。 通知を受けた人が、確認すべきダッシュボード、使用すべきプレイブック、影響を受けるサービスを素早く特定できるように、アラート通知に十分なコンテキストを追加します。 ダッシュボード: ペルソナ/ステークホルダーごとに 1 つ以上のダッシュボードを作成します。 アプリケーション開発者は、問題を診断し、アプリケーションのパフォーマンスを理解するのに十分なコンテキストが必要です。 プラットフォームエンジニアは、SLO への影響と注意が必要なインフラストラクチャコンポーネント、およびそれらを使用するサービスへの影響を特定するためのコンテキストを含むダッシュボードが必要です。 プロダクトマネージャーは、ユーザージャーニー、製品機能の使用状況メトリクス、採用率、離脱ポイントなどを示すダッシュボードが必要です。 ビジネスステークホルダーは、製品採用率、購読者の離脱、またはビジネスパフォーマンスと収益に影響を与える可能性のあるものを示すウィジェットに関心があります。 すべてのダッシュボードで一貫したタイムゾーン（例：UTC）を使用します。 ダッシュボード上のすべてのウィジェットで同じ時間範囲を使用します。 注釈を使用してダッシュボードにより多くのコンテキストを追加します。 エラー解決を支援するコンテキストを追加するウィジェットのみがダッシュボードにあることを確認します。ウィジェットが多すぎると、ノイズと認知的過負荷が増え、MTTR が高くなります。 その他のあると便利なウィジェットは、別のダッシュボードに移動するか、すでに多すぎるウィジェットがない場合はダッシュボードの下部に移動します。ウィジェットが多すぎると、読み込み時間に影響し、ストレスと認知的過負荷が高くなります。 ダッシュボード全体が 1 つの画面に収まり、ラップトップの解像度と画面サイズでトレンドが表示されることを確認します。 ダッシュボードの説明とその使用方法に関するガイダンスを含むウィジェットを用意します。 ウィジェットにしきい値を設定して表示します。 トレンドやスパイクが平滑化され、目的を損なう可能性のある単一のウィジェットに多くのメトリクスを詰め込まないでください。これは診断も困難にします。 トレンドとスパイクを表示できるように、動的に調整される Y 軸を使用します。 推奨事項: コスト管理: ステークホルダーの特定: 機能性、可用性、セキュリティ、コスト、販売、製品使用などの機能パフォーマンスに関心のある異なるペルソナを特定します。 ステークホルダーには、開発チーム、エンドカスタマー、社内のビジネスステークホルダー、プラットフォーム運用チーム、アプリケーション開発者が含まれます。 主要な成果の特定: 各ステークホルダーに対して、通常 Service Level Objectives (SLO) を使用して測定される定量化可能な成果（エラー率、リクエスト処理時間、1 分あたりのログイン数、1 分あたりの購入製品数、放棄されたカートの数など）を定義します。 これらのペルソナごとの SLO を使用して、必要な計測を特定します。 適切なシグナルの選択: 十分なコンテキストを持つ広範なログは、メトリクスとトレースに変換でき、単一の真実のソースを提供し、コストを制御し、シグナルの相関関係を可能にします。 オブザーバビリティ戦略ワークショップ を実行して、アプリケーションに組み込むべき適切なシグナルを特定します。 適切なシグナルの選択: ログとトレースは、障害や予期しない動作の根本原因を見つけるのに役立ちます。「特定のリクエストが失敗した理由は？」や「リクエスト処理時間の p50 または p99 が増加した場合、リクエスト処理時間に関連する SLO について知る必要があることは何か？」といった質問に答えるのに役立つログを追加してください。 メトリクスは、ベースラインのパフォーマンスを理解し、トレンドと異常を予測するのに適しています。これらは、何かが期待通りに機能していないことを事前に示すことができます。ただし、カスタムメトリクスは高価です。 アラート疲れの軽減: 設定に応じて、アラートはシステムの問題を事前または事後に強調表示できます。アラートが多すぎると、アラート疲れと非効率的なチームにつながり、コード品質と製品提供の質が低下する可能性があります。 定期的なレビューと継続的な改善: チームのメンバーがダッシュボードを監視し、特定された新しいトレンドやパターンを報告するための定期的なローテーションを設けます。 レトロスペクティブとローテーション観察で特定されたギャップに基づいて、シグナルの改善、アラートしきい値の調整、ダッシュボードの改善のために、各リリースの一部を割り当てます。 解決に必要な労力とアラートのトリガー回数に基づいて、繰り返し発生するアラートの根本原因の修正を優先順位付けします。 プロファイリングとパフォーマンスの最適化​ リアルユーザーモニタリング (RUM): AWS X-Ray や New Relic などのツールを使用して、実際のユーザーインタラクションを監視し、パフォーマンスのボトルネックを特定します。主要なコンバージョンポイントに焦点を当て、技術的なパフォーマンスとビジネス成果（コンバージョン率、離脱ポイント）の両方を測定します。 決済フローや登録プロセスなどの重要なユーザーパスの監視を優先します。 ベースラインとなるパフォーマンスとユーザー行動を確立し、ビジネス成果に影響を与える可能性のある異常や傾向を素早く特定できるようにします。 Synthetics: Amazon Cloudwatch Synthetics などのツールを使用して、様々な条件下でユーザーインタラクションをシミュレートし、アプリケーションのパフォーマンスをテストします。Synthetic Canary は、ユーザーへの影響が検出される前に問題を特定するのに役立ちます。 Synthetic Canary を使用してヘルスチェックとシステムの稼働時間を検証します。 プロファイリングツール: AWS X-Ray などのツールを使用してプロファイリングを行い、パフォーマンスのボトルネックを特定し、リソース使用率を最適化します。 トラフィックパターンに基づいて動的にサンプリングレートを調整し、エラートレースと外れ値の適切な保持を維持します。これにより、データ量とコストを効果的に管理しながら、重要な問題への包括的な可視性を確保します。 テールサンプリングを使用して、エラーステータス、期間のしきい値、カスタム属性に基づいて高価値のトレースを優先する複数のサンプリングポリシーでコレクターを設定します。これにより、最も価値のあるトレースがサンプリングに含まれることが保証されます。 OpenTelemetry: OpenTelemetry を使用して自動計装を行い、パフォーマンスメトリクスとトレースの収集を簡素化します。手動計装を追加する前に自動計装によって提供されるテレメトリを検証し、その後、シグナルとコストを制御するための要件に基づいて自動計装を調整します。 エラー処理とデバッグ技法​ 一般: 一時的な障害に対して指数関数的バックオフを伴うリトライメカニズムを設計します。外部依存関係に対してサーキットブレーカーを実装します。これは分散システムで特に有効で、下流のコンポーネント/サービスへの過剰な負荷を防ぎます。すべてのシナリオに適用できるわけではないため、この設計を採用する前に適切な検討を行ってください。 重要な操作にはフォールバックメカニズムを作成し、失敗したトランザクションに対する明確なロールバック手順を維持します。 すべてのエントリーポイントで入力バリデーションを追加します。 リトライ可能な操作は冪等性を確保します。 ロギング: 保存した CloudWatch Log Insights クエリのリポジトリを維持します。フォルダを使用してクエリをグループ化します。 エラーを抑制しないでください。常に適切にログを記録するか処理してください。 その他の関連コンテキストに加えて、相関 ID やリクエスト ID などの識別子をログに追加します。 プレイブックとランブック: プレイブックを作成する際は、必要な権限、ツール、期待される結果を含む明確なアクションステップを含めます。 プレイブックとランブックには、検証手順、ロールバック手順、関連するダッシュボードへのリンクを含めます。 プレイブックをバージョン管理し、インシデント後に学びと重要な洞察を含めて更新します。 サンプリングルールの調整: サービスの重要度とトラフィックパターンに基づいて動的なサンプリングルールを実装します。 エラー条件とビジネスクリティカルなパスに対してより高いサンプリングレートを設定します。 運用上のニーズとコストを考慮して、サンプリングルールを定期的に見直し調整します。 コードレビューとコラボレーション戦略​ チケットの詳細化： 機能の詳細化プロセスの一部としてオブザーバビリティの要件を特定します。これには以下が含まれます： 影響を受けるステークホルダーと関連する SLO 必要なテレメトリ/シグナル 必要なアラート 作成または更新が必要なダッシュボードのリスト ブレームレス（非難なし）レトロスペクティブ： インシデント発生後は必ずブレームレスレトロスペクティブを実施し、プロセスの改善や自動化の追加機会を探します。 変更のコストを常に考慮し、ポストモーテム（事後分析）の際には、必ず実行可能な項目を少なくとも 1 つ合意し、その完了までの期限を設定してください。 運用準備状況レビュー： プラットフォームチームと運用チームと共に運用準備状況レビューに参加し、オブザーバビリティ体制のギャップを特定します。 これはチェックリストとして、本番環境へのデプロイ前の必須の演習となります。 複数のチームを持つ大規模な組織では、このプロセスがボトルネックとなることを避けるため、新機能やリリースのサイクルに応じて定期的に実施します。 推奨事項： インシデント後の分析をガイドするために、AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager のようなツールを使用します。 運用準備状況レビューのチェックリストやプロセスに含める質問の参考として、Operational Readiness Review を参照してください。 レトロスペクティブや運用準備状況レビューから得られた知見は、常に wiki やメーリングリストを通じて共有してください。 API の設計とドキュメントのガイドライン​ バージョニング: API にはバージョンを付与し、処理される全てのリクエストにバージョンをコンテキストとして追加します カスタムメトリクスを送信する場合、該当する場合はディメンションにバージョンを追加します ダッシュボードには、あるバージョンから別のバージョンへの切り替えを明確に区別できるよう、注釈または識別子を追加します 各バージョンへのリクエストを追跡し、バージョンの使用状況を可視化するウィジェットを追加します。これは、リクエストが期待通りにルーティングされていることを確認し、根本原因の特定時間を短縮するためです。これにより、古いバージョンを廃止して削除する際の信頼性が向上します 後方互換性: 古い API バージョンに関連するコードパスを削除する前に、古いバージョンへのリクエストがないことを確認します バッチ API: 個々のリクエストのステータスとバッチリクエスト全体のシグナルを発行します ログにバッチリクエスト ID と個別リクエストを識別するコンテキストを追加します このページを編集 前へ データサイエンティスト、AI/ML、MLOps エンジニア 次へ DevOps 開発者にとってオブザーバビリティが重要な理由 コード品質のベストプラクティス 効率的なロギングとモニタリング

リーダーは、複数の面で増大する圧力に直面しています。 収益に直接影響を与えるデジタルサービス、信頼性に対する前例のない顧客の期待、技術的な回復力に左右される競争優位性、そして、より高い運用の透明性を要求する規制要件などです。 この収束により、IT リーダーは効果的なオブザーバビリティ戦略を通じて、オペレーショナルエクセレンスと具体的なビジネス価値の創造の両方を実証する必要があります。 これらの課題を踏まえ、組織はオブザーバビリティを技術的なオーバーヘッドとしてではなく、定量化可能なリターンを伴う戦略的投資として捉える必要があります。 IT リーダーは、オブザーバビリティへの取り組みが、顧客満足度からオペレーションコストまで、ビジネスメトリクスにどのように直接影響を与えるかを実証する必要があります。 ROI 重視のアプローチにより、オブザーバビリティのツールと実践に費やされる全ての投資が、インシデント対応時間、システムの信頼性、チームの生産性の測定可能な改善をもたらし、最終的に収益を保護・向上させることが保証されます。 古くからの経営原則「測定できないものは管理できない」は、ここで特に当てはまります。 そのため、業界のリーダーたちは、オブザーバビリティをファーストクラスの機能要件として重視しています。 リーダーとして、根本原因分析 (RCA) を加速し、平均復旧時間 (MTTR) を削減することが目標である場合、オブザーバビリティ戦略は組織の中核的なビジネス目標と優先事項と密接に結びついている必要があります。 これにより、生成されるインサイトが組織の重要業績評価指標 (KPI) の改善を直接サポートすることが保証されます。 そして、市場で最新かつ最高の AI オブザーバビリティツールに投資することではなく、組織の目標に沿ったシグナルを「測定」できることが重要なのです！ 効果的なオブザーバビリティ戦略の構築​ オブザーバビリティを具体的なビジネス成果にどのように結びつけるのでしょうか？その答えは、以下の重要な領域に焦点を当てることにあります：カスタマーエクスペリエンス、アプリケーションのパフォーマンスと信頼性、そして運用効率とコスト最適化です。オブザーバビリティを具体的なビジネス成果に結びつけるために、最も重要な側面であるカスタマーエクスペリエンスから始めましょう。 カスタマーエクスペリエンスの測定​ まず、カスタマーエクスペリエンスを測定するには、従来のシステムメトリクスを超えた取り組みが必要です。 主要な測定フレームワークとして、Service Level Objectives (SLOs) の実装をお勧めします。 SLOs は、単なるシステムメトリクスではなく、重要なエンドユーザージャーニーに基づいてサービスの可用性目標を設定します。 このカスタマー中心のアプローチにより、オブザーバビリティ戦略が最も重要なエンドユーザーエクスペリエンスに直接的に整合することを保証します。これは、すべての技術的な判断の指針となるべきものです。 ここで、お客様への保証を表す用語と、サービスの健全性を示す追跡可能な測定値について理解を深めましょう。 Service Level Indicator (SLI) は、提供されるサービスレベルの特定の側面を定量的に測定する、慎重に定義された指標です。 Service Level Objective (SLO) は、一定期間にわたって SLI で測定されるサービスレベルの目標値または値の範囲です。 Service Level Agreement (SLA) は、提供を約束するサービスレベルを概説したお客様との契約です。SLA には、追加サポートや価格割引など、要件が満たされない場合の対応も詳細に記載されています。 Amazon CloudWatch Application Signals の導入により、AWS でネイティブに SLO を作成し監視できるようになりました。 Application Signals は CloudWatch で包括的なアプリケーションパフォーマンス監視ソリューションを提供し、SLO を APM エクスペリエンスに接続することができます。 CloudWatch で利用可能な任意のメトリクスを使用して SLO を開始できます。 これにより、現在 CloudWatch で利用可能なメトリクスを使用して簡単に開始できます。 詳細については、ブログ Improve application reliability with effective SLOs を参照してください。 顧客満足度は最も重要ですが、それはアプリケーションのパフォーマンスと信頼性に直接結びついています。 これらの重要な側面を監視し改善する方法について探っていきましょう。 アプリケーションのパフォーマンスと信頼性の向上​ アプリケーションの信頼性は、効果的なオブザーバビリティの次の柱を形成します。これは、アプリケーションの重要な「ゴールデンシグナル」である可用性、レイテンシー、エラー、トラフィックを監視することで実現されます。これらのメトリクスは、アプリケーションの健全性とパフォーマンスを包括的に把握することができます。SLO と組み合わせることで、運用コストを最適化しながら高い信頼性を維持するための強力なフレームワークを構築できます。 Amazon Route 53 ヘルスチェック と CloudWatch Synthetics を使用することで、アプリケーションとワークロードのパフォーマンスとランタイムの側面を監視および分析できます。また、AWS CloudWatch Synthetics を使用してオンプレミスアプリケーションの可用性と健全性を監視することもできます。 Network Flow Monitor、Internet Monitor、Network Synthetic Monitor が提供する Amazon CloudWatch ネットワークとインターネット監視 機能を使用することで、AWS でホストされているアプリケーションのネットワークとインターネットのパフォーマンスと可用性に関するデータの可視化、インサイトの取得、運用の可視性を得ることができます。 Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights を使用することで、コンテナ化されたアプリケーションとマイクロサービスのメトリクスとログを収集、集約、要約できます。Container Insights は、Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)、Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)、Amazon EC2 上の Kubernetes プラットフォームで利用できます。 Amazon CloudWatch Database Insights を使用することで、Amazon Aurora MySQL、Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL、Amazon RDS for SQL Server、RDS for MySQL、RDS for PostgreSQL、RDS for Oracle、RDS for MariaDB データベースを大規模に監視およびトラブルシューティングできます。 Amazon CloudWatch クロスアカウントオブザーバビリティ を使用することで、リージョン内の複数のアカウントにまたがるアプリケーションを監視およびトラブルシューティングできます。アカウントの境界を意識することなく、リンクされたアカウントのメトリクス、ログ、トレース、Application Signals サービス、サービスレベル目標 (SLO)、Application Insights アプリケーション、インターネットモニターを検索、可視化、分析できます。 Amazon Managed Grafana を使用することで、運用データを大規模に可視化および分析できます。AWS データソースとのシームレスな統合を提供し、統合ダッシュボードを通じてチーム間のコラボレーションを可能にすることで、アプリケーションとインフラストラクチャからのメトリクス、ログ、トレースを含む複数のソースからのオブザーバビリティデータを、カスタマイズ可能な可視化に統合し、運用上の問題を迅速に特定して解決することができます。 堅牢な顧客体験とアプリケーションパフォーマンスの監視を実現したところで、次は戦略に関連するコストの最適化に注目していきましょう。 コストの最適化​ 効果的なオブザーバビリティからは、自然とコスト最適化が生まれます。多くの組織は、すべてをモニタリングするという罠に陥ります。これは「取り残される不安」(FOMO) 症候群とも呼ばれ、洞察よりもノイズを生み出す複雑でリソース集約的なシステムにつながります。重要なのは、ビジネスサービスの成功とユーザーエクスペリエンスの向上に直接関連する KPI を特定することです。成功の鍵は、戦略的なデータ収集と、何よりもオブザーバビリティの過程全体でビジネスステークホルダーを巻き込むことにあります。オブザーバビリティ戦略は、根本原因分析 (RCA) の加速、平均復旧時間 (MTTR) の短縮、そして最終的な運用コストの削減を実証可能な形で実現する必要があります。その際、ビジネスに真の影響を与えるこれらの主要メトリクスに焦点を当て続けることが重要です。 AWS Cost Explorer は、使いやすいインターフェースを提供し、時間の経過とともに AWS のコストと使用状況を可視化、理解、管理することができます。Cost Explorer は、AWS Cost and Usage Reports と詳細な請求レポートの生成に使用されるのと同じデータセットを使用します。Amazon CloudWatch 請求アラームを作成することで、推定 AWS 料金を監視できます。AWS アカウントの推定料金の監視を有効にすると、推定料金が 1 日に数回計算され、メトリクスデータとして CloudWatch に送信されます。アラームは、アカウントの請求額が指定したしきい値を超えると発動します。 効果的なオブザーバビリティ戦略の主要コンポーネントを説明したところで、その実装から期待できる具体的なメリットとビジネスへの影響について見ていきましょう。 定量化可能な成果とビジネスへの影響​ 適切に実装されたオブザーバビリティ戦略は、組織全体に定量的な財務リターンと定性的な利点の両方をもたらします。 期待できる成果をいくつか見ていきましょう： コスト削減​ 戦略的なオブザーバビリティは、直接的なコスト削減と収益保護という 2 つの経路を通じて財務的なメリットをもたらします。 MTTR の削減と予防措置によって測定される運用の改善は、インシデントコストと解決時間の削減を通じて即座にコスト削減効果を生み出します。 これらの削減効果は、労働時間の削減として定量化されるチーム効率の向上によってさらに増幅されます。 顧客生涯価値の観点から見ると、わずかな顧客維持率の改善でも、大幅な収益保護につながる可能性があります。 オペレーショナルの効率性​ リソースの最適化により、インフラストラクチャのコストを 40% 以上削減できることがよくあります。 定型作業の自動化により手作業が不要になり、削減された作業時間と人件費を掛け合わせることで、コスト削減効果を算出できます。 これらの効率化は時間とともに積み重なり、持続的なコスト削減効果を生み出します。 文化の変革とオペレーショナルエクセレンス​ オブザーバビリティの真の力は、文化と運用の両方を同時に変革できる能力にあります。 自動化されたアラートの相関分析とコンテキストに基づくトラブルシューティングが即座に効率性を向上させる一方で、より深い影響は、チームの働き方とコラボレーションの方法における根本的な変化から生まれます。 セルフサービス機能は独立した問題解決を可能にし、包括的な可視性により、プロアクティブなリスク管理が実現します。 これにより、顧客満足度の向上、開発者体験の改善、セキュリティ体制の強化が相互に強化し合う好循環が生まれます。 定量化可能な成果を理解することで、組織におけるオブザーバビリティの将来への道が開かれます。 この戦略がどのように運用を変革し、長期的な成功を導くかを見ることで、まとめとしましょう。 前進への道のり​ 効果的なオブザーバビリティへの道のりは、単にツールを実装したりデータを収集したりするだけではありません。組織の運営方法、意思決定、価値提供の方法を変革することが重要です。 意味のあるメトリクスに焦点を当て、技術的な能力をビジネス成果と整合させ、自動化とセルフサービス機能によってチームを強化することで、組織はオブザーバビリティを戦略的な優位性に変えることができます。 ますますデジタル化が進む世界において、この分野を習得した組織は、顧客の期待に応え、イノベーションを推進し、持続可能な成長を達成するための準備が整うでしょう。 未来は、単にデータを収集するだけでなく、ビジネスの成功を導くための実用的な洞察に変換できる組織のものとなります。 このページを編集 前へ DevOps 次へ セキュリティの専門家 効果的なオブザーバビリティ戦略の構築

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) は、ソフトウェアシステムの信頼性とパフォーマンスの向上に焦点を当てたソフトウェアエンジニアリングの実践手法です。 SRE の主要な目標の 1 つは、可用性、パフォーマンス、レイテンシー、効率性、キャパシティ、インシデント対応などの分野でソフトウェアシステムの信頼性を向上させることです。 SRE チームが目標の達成を検証するために測定する指標には、Service Level Agreement (SLA)、Service Level Objective (SLO)、Service Level Indicator (SLI)、エラーバジェットなどがあります。 以下は、オブザーバビリティ戦略を導くための SRE の重点分野とベストプラクティスです。 インシデント対応とクライシス管理​ インシデント対応には、インシデント解決までの平均時間 (MTTR) を最小限に抑え、Service Level Agreement (SLA) を満たすことを目的として、計画外のイベントや中断を監視、検出、対応することが含まれます。 インシデント対応とクライシス管理に関するベストプラクティス：​ 迅速な検知、対応、封じ込めは、最小限の時間でインシデントを緩和し、さらなる影響を回避するために重要です。 オンコールスケジュールを効率化し、効果的なインシデント緩和のための運用手順書を組み込んだ、堅牢なオンコールシステムを構築します。 効果的なインシデント後の分析プロセスを構築します。根本原因分析には通常、以下の項目が含まれます。 影響分析 - このインシデントによって影響を受けたシステム、内部プロセス、エンドユーザー、および発生した可能性のある財務的影響を特定します。 根本原因と解決策 - イベントの根本原因分析を実施し、将来同様のシナリオが再発することを防ぐためのガードレールを実装する機会を特定します。 モニタリングとアラーム - 設定されたメトリクスとアラームのしきい値が正しいシグナルを報告しているか、潜在的なインシデントを防止する機会があるかを特定します。 アクションアイテムと学習 - アクションアイテムに担当者を割り当て、フォローアップを行います。インシデントからの学びを製品ライフサイクルに組み込み、将来の障害を防ぐためのフィードバックメカニズムを確立することが重要です。 サービスレベル目標と主要メトリクス​ SLI (Service Level Indicator) は、実際の測定値やメトリクスです。例として、ミリ秒単位のレスポンス時間、システムの稼働率、100 万リクエストあたりのエラー率、1 秒あたりのリクエスト数によるスループット、リソース使用率（CPU、メモリなど）があります。 SLO (Service Level Objective) は、SLI を使用して設定される目標値です。これは「良好なサービス」とは何かを定義します。例として、95% のリクエストが 200 ミリ秒以内に完了すること、月間稼働率 99.9%、30 日間のエラー率が 0.1% 未満などがあります。SLI と SLO の関係は以下のように定義できます。 SLI（メトリクス）+ 目標値 + 時間枠 = SLO 例：レスポンス時間（SLI）+ 200 ミリ秒未満 + 30 日間の測定 = SLO SLI と SLO のベストプラクティスは以下の通りです​ SLO に SMART フレームワークを確立する Specific (具体的): 明確なメトリクスとしきい値 (「応答時間が 200ms 未満」)。 Measurable (測定可能): モニタリングツールで追跡可能。 Achievable (達成可能): システム能力に応じた現実的な目標。 Relevant (関連性): ユーザーエクスペリエンスに関連している。 Time-bound (期限付き): 定義された期間で測定 (例: 30 日間)。 ユーザーエクスペリエンスに直接影響する SLI を選択する。 ビジネスニーズに基づいた現実的な SLO 目標を設定する。 定期的なモニタリングと調整を行う。 明確な文書化とコミュニケーションを行う。 必要に応じて、サービスレベルごとに異なる SLO を設定する。 以下のような主要メトリクスを特定する レイテンシー: システムがリクエストに応答するまでの時間を測定し、成功時とエラー時の両方のレイテンシーを追跡。 トラフィック: システムを通過するリクエストやデータの量を監視し、使用パターンとスケール要件を理解。 エラー: システム内で発生するエラーの頻度とタイプを追跡。 飽和度: CPU やメモリなどの重要なリソースの使用率を監視し、潜在的なボトルネックを特定。 以下は SLO ドキュメントの例です サービス: ユーザー認証 API SLO: 認証リクエストの 99.9% が 500ms 以内に完了 測定期間: 30 日間の移動期間 SLI: サーバーで測定された応答時間 除外事項: 計画されたメンテナンス期間 キャパシティプランニングとスケーリング​ キャパシティプランニングとイベントレディネスは、システムの信頼性を確保するための重要な要素です。 ベストプラクティスの例​ 予想されるユーザートラフィックパターン、ユーザーの地理的分布、対象となる AWS リージョン、イベントのピーク時間などの主要コンポーネントを含む、包括的なイベントカレンダーを実装します。 システムのスケーリング検証、パフォーマンスベンチマーク、容量しきい値のテストを含むイベントレディネステストを実施します。 バックアップと復元手順、リージョン切り替えの実行手順、インシデント対応プロトコル、緩和手順などのフェイルオーバーメカニズムを検証します。 インフラストラクチャ管理のための自動化とスクリプティング​ インフラストラクチャの効率的な運用には自動化が重要です。自動化により、より信頼性が高く、スケーラブルで効率的なインフラストラクチャを実現し、チームは日常的なメンテナンスではなく戦略的な取り組みに集中できるようになります。自動化の利点には以下のようなものがあります。 人的介入をほとんど、またはまったく必要としないシステムの信頼性向上。 トラフィックと需要に応じてアプリケーションが自動的にスケールできる、改善されたスケーラビリティ。 迅速かつ自動化されたインシデント解決、エラー率の低減、MTBF（平均故障間隔）の改善。 運用コストの削減とリソース使用率の向上。 主要な自動化戦略には以下が含まれます​ バージョン管理されたインフラストラクチャの変更と共に、Infrastructure as Code (IaC) を実装。 自動テストとロールバック機能を含む、継続的インテグレーション/継続的デプロイメント (CI/CD)。 統合されたヘルスチェックと自動復旧機能を備えた自己修復システム。 SRE チームのためのモニタリングとアラート戦略​ 効果的なモニタリングとアラートは、分散型のマイクロサービスベースのアプリケーションの信頼性とパフォーマンスを積極的に確保するために、Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) チームにとって重要です。 数百のマイクロサービスを持つ可能性のある分散システムのモニタリングは課題となる場合があります。 アーキテクチャの複雑さに関係なく、重要なメトリクスを特定し、それらがアプリケーションのパフォーマンスとユーザーエクスペリエンスに与える影響から Working Backwards する必要があります。 包括的なテレメトリの収集​ アーキテクチャの各コンポーネントの健全性とパフォーマンスについて、十分な洞察を提供するテレメトリデータを収集していることを確認します。 収集したデータの関連性とアクション可能性を継続的に評価します。 アラート戦略​ アクションにつながるアラートを定義する - テレメトリデータから生成されるアラートは、SRE チームが問題を素早く特定し対応できるよう、アクションにつながるものである必要があります。アラートは、意味のある、かつ潜在的な問題を予測できる閾値とパターンに基づいて設定する必要があります。 アラートのルーティングとエスカレーションを最適化する - 重要な問題について適切なチームや個人に通知されるよう、明確に定義されたアラートのルーティングとエスカレーションのプロセスを実装します。対応性を向上させアラート疲れを最小限に抑えるため、アラートのルーティングを継続的にレビューし改善します。 ダッシュボードと可視化​ 包括的なダッシュボードの作成 - アプリケーションの状態を全体的に把握できるダッシュボードを作成します。これには、主要な運用メトリクス、コストと容量計画のデータ、インフラストラクチャの健全性が含まれます。問題を効果的に予測し防止できるよう、ダッシュボードにはしきい値とインジケータを含めるようにします。 データ駆動型の意思決定の実現 - ダッシュボードから得られたインサイトを活用して、容量計画、パフォーマンスの最適化、インシデント対応戦略などのデータ駆動型の意思決定プロセスを実現します。 カオスエンジニアリングと実験のガイドライン​ カオスエンジニアリングの目的は、アプリケーションの信頼性をテストし、停止、トラフィックの急増、その他の外部イベントなどの破壊的なイベントに対してアプリケーションがどのように応答するかを理解することです。 カオスエンジニアリングは、チームがパフォーマンスのボトルネックやアプリケーションの動作を評価し、実際のシナリオで障害を修復するための戦略を実装するのに役立ちます。 カオスエンジニアリングのベストプラクティス​ 小規模から始めて徐々に複雑さを増やす - これには仮説の構築が含まれます（例えば、アプリケーションのトラフィックが 30% 増加した場合、どのように動作するか）。 定常状態を定義する。 実験を通して障害を導入する。 システムの動作を観察し、回復力を高めるための是正措置を講じる。 堅牢なモニタリングを実装する - 効果的なカオスエンジニアリングのために、ログ、メトリクス、トレースなどの関連するテレメトリデータを収集していることを確認する。 常にロールバック計画を持つ - カオスエンジニアリングを CI/CD パイプラインに統合することで、ロールバック計画の自動化とテストが可能になる。 各実験から学び、結果を文書化し、システムの回復力を向上させ、カオスエンジニアリングを開発ライフサイクルに統合する。 これらのカオスエンジニアリングのプラクティスを体系的に実装することで、組織はシステムの回復力を大幅に向上させ、予期せないダウンタイムを削減し、より信頼性の高いサービスを構築できます。 目的はカオスを引き起こすことではなく、カオスな状況に耐えられるシステムを構築することであることを忘れないでください。 参考資料​ AWS Observability Workshop AWS

ディメンション このサイトでは、オブザーバビリティの領域を 6 つのディメンションで考えます。 各ディメンションを独立して見ることは、分析的な観点から有益です。 つまり、特定のワークロードに対して具体的なオブザーバビリティソリューションを構築する際に、使用するプログラミング言語などの開発者関連の側面や、コンテナや Lambda 関数などのランタイム環境といった運用上のトピックを網羅することができます。 注記 「シグナルとは何か？」 ここでいうシグナルとは、ログエントリ、メトリクス、トレースを含む、あらゆる種類のオブザーバビリティデータとメタデータポイントを意味します。 より具体的である必要がある場合を除き、「シグナル」という用語を使用し、文脈から適用される制限を理解できるようにしています。 それでは、6 つのディメンションを 1 つずつ見ていきましょう： 出力先​ この次元では、長期ストレージやシグナルを利用するためのグラフィカルインターフェースなど、あらゆる種類のシグナルの出力先を考慮します。 開発者として、サービスのトラブルシューティングのためにシグナルを発見、検索、相関付けできる UI や API へのアクセスが必要です。 インフラストラクチャやプラットフォームの役割では、インフラストラクチャの状態を理解するためにシグナルを管理、発見、検索、相関付けできる UI や API へのアクセスが必要です。 最終的に、これは人間の観点から見て最も興味深い次元です。 しかし、その恩恵を受けるためには、まず少し作業が必要です。 ソフトウェアと外部依存関係を計装し、シグナルを出力先に取り込む必要があります。 では、シグナルはどのように出力先に到達するのでしょうか？ 良い質問ですね。それは... エージェント​ シグナルの収集と分析への経路について説明します。シグナルは 2 つのソースから取得できます。1 つはアプリケーションのソースコード (言語セクションを参照) から、もう 1 つはアプリケーションが依存するもの、つまりデータストアで管理される状態や VPC などのインフラストラクチャ (インフラとデータのセクションを参照) からです。 エージェントは、シグナルを収集して取り込むために使用するテレメトリの一部です。テレメトリのもう一部は、計装されたアプリケーションやデータベースなどのインフラ要素です。 プログラミング言語​ この観点は、サービスやアプリケーションを作成するために使用するプログラミング言語に関するものです。 ここでは、X-Ray SDK や OpenTelemetry が 計装 のコンテキストで提供するような SDK やライブラリを扱います。 ログやメトリクスなどの特定のシグナルタイプに対して、選択したプログラミング言語をオブザーバビリティソリューションがサポートしていることを確認する必要があります。 インフラストラクチャとデータベース​ この次元では、サービスが実行されている VPC のようなインフラストラクチャ、RDS や DynamoDB のようなデータストア、SQS のようなキューなど、アプリケーションの外部依存関係を指します。 ヒント \"共通点\" この次元のすべてのソースに共通する点は、アプリケーション（およびアプリケーションが実行されるコンピューティング環境）の外部に位置しており、不透明なボックスとして扱う必要があるということです。 この次元には以下のものが含まれますが、これらに限定されません： AWS インフラストラクチャ（例：VPC フローログ） Kubernetes コントロールプレーンログ などのセカンダリ API S3、RDS、SQS などのデータストアからのシグナル コンピュートユニット​ コードをパッケージ化し、スケジュールし、実行する方法です。例えば、Lambda では関数であり、ECS と EKS では、それぞれタスク (ECS) または Pod (EKS) で実行されるコンテナがそのユニットとなります。 Kubernetes のようなコンテナ化された環境では、テレメトリーのデプロイに関して、サイドカーまたはノード (インスタンス) ごとのデーモンプロセスという 2 つのオプションが提供されています。 コンピュートエンジン​ このディメンションは、基本的なランタイム環境を指します。これは、(例えば EC2 インスタンスの場合のように) プロビジョニングとパッチ適用が必要な場合もあれば、(Fargate や Lambda などのサーバーレスサービスのように) 必要ない場合もあります。 使用するコンピュートエンジンによっては、テレメトリ部分がすでにサービスの一部として提供されている場合があります。例えば、EKS on Fargate には Fluent Bit による統合されたログルーティングが含まれています。 このページを編集

Amazon Managed Grafana を自動化する方法を紹介します。 例えば、複数のワークスペースにわたってデータソースやダッシュボードを一貫して追加する方法を説明します。 注記 このガイドは完了までに約 30 分かかります。 前提条件​ ローカル環境に AWS command line がインストールされ、設定 されていること。 ローカル環境に Terraform コマンドラインがインストールされていること。 使用可能な Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus ワークスペースがあること。 使用可能な Amazon Managed Grafana ワークスペースがあること。 Amazon Managed Grafana のセットアップ​ Terraform が Grafana に対して認証を行うために、パスワードのような役割を果たす API キーを使用します。 備考 API キーは、Grafana API に対するすべてのリクエストで呼び出し元を認証する、51 文字の英数字の値を持つ RFC 6750 HTTP Bearer ヘッダーです。 そのため、Terraform マニフェストをセットアップする前に、まず API キーを作成する必要があります。以下の手順で Grafana UI から作成します。 まず、左側のメニューの Configuration セクションから API keys メニュー項目を選択します： 次に、新しい API キーを作成し、タスクに適した名前を付け、Admin ロールを割り当て、有効期間を例えば 1 日に設定します： 注記 API キーの有効期限は限られており、AMG では最大 30 日まで設定できます。 Add ボタンをクリックすると、API キーを含むポップアップダイアログが表示されます： 警告 API キーが表示されるのはこの時だけです。後で Terraform マニフェストで必要になるので、ここで安全な場所に保存してください。 これで、Terraform を使用した自動化のために必要な Amazon Managed Grafana のセットアップが完了しました。次のステップに進みましょう。 Terraform による自動化​ Terraform の準備​ Terraform が Grafana と連携できるように、バージョン 1.13.3 以上の公式 Grafana プロバイダー を使用します。 以下では、データソースの作成を自動化します。具体的には、Prometheus データソース、つまり AMP ワークスペースを追加します。 まず、以下の内容で main.tf というファイルを作成します： terraform { required_providers { grafana = { source = \"grafana/grafana\" version = \">= 1.13.3\" } } } provider \"grafana\" { url = \"INSERT YOUR GRAFANA WORKSPACE URL HERE\" auth = \"INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE\" } resource \"grafana_data_source\" \"prometheus\" { type = \"prometheus\" name = \"amp\" is_default = true url = \"INSERT YOUR AMP WORKSPACE URL HERE \" json_data { http_method = \"POST\" sigv4_auth = true sigv4_auth_type = \"workspace-iam-role\" sigv4_region = \"eu-west-1\" } } 上記のファイルには、環境に応じて 3 つの値を挿入する必要があります。 Grafana プロバイダーセクションでは： url … Grafana ワークスペース URL で、以下のような形式です： https://xxxxxxxx.grafana-workspace.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com auth … 前のステップで作成した API キー Prometheus リソースセクションでは、url に AMP ワークスペース URL を挿入します。 形式は https://aps-workspaces.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/workspaces/ws-xxxxxxxxx です。 注記 ファイルに示されているものとは異なるリージョンで Amazon Managed Grafana を使用している場合は、上記に加えて sigv4_region をお使いのリージョンに設定する必要があります。 準備フェーズを完了するために、Terraform を初期化しましょう： $ terraform init Initializing the backend... Initializing provider plugins... - Finding grafana/grafana versions matching \">= 1.13.3\"... - Installing grafana/grafana v1.13.3... - Installed grafana/grafana v1.13.3 (signed by a HashiCorp partner, key ID 570AA42029AE241A) Partner and community providers are signed by their developers. If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here: https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary. これで準備が整い、以下で説明するようにデータソースの作成を Terraform で自動化できます。 Terraform の使用​ 通常、最初に以下のように Terraform のプランを確認します： $ terraform plan Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # grafana_data_source.prometheus will be created + resource \"grafana_data_source\" \"prometheus\" { + access_mode = \"proxy\" + basic_auth_enabled = false + id = (known after apply) + is_default = true + name = \"amp\" + type = \"prometheus\" + url = \"https://aps-workspaces.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/workspaces/ws-xxxxxx/\" + json_data { + http_method = \"POST\" + sigv4_auth = true + sigv4_auth_type = \"workspace-iam-role\" + sigv4_region = \"eu-west-1\" } } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run \"terraform apply\" now. プランの内容に問題がなければ、以下のようにプランを適用できます： $ terraform apply Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # grafana_data_source.prometheus will be created + resource \"grafana_data_source\" \"prometheus\" { + access_mode = \"proxy\" + basic_auth_enabled = false + id = (known after apply) + is_default = true + name = \"amp\" + type = \"prometheus\" + url = \"https://aps-workspaces.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/workspaces/ws-xxxxxxxxx/\" + json_data { + http_method = \"POST\" + sigv4_auth = true + sigv4_auth_type = \"workspace-iam-role\" + sigv4_region = \"eu-west-1\" } } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. Do you want to perform these actions? Terraform will perform the actions described above. Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve. Enter a value: yes grafana_data_source.prometheus: Creating... grafana_data_source.prometheus: Creation complete after 1s [id=10] Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. Grafana のデータソースリストに移動すると、以下のような画面が表示されるはずです： 新しく作成したデータソースが機能しているかを確認するには、下部にある青い Save & test ボタンをクリックします。 結果として「Data source is working」という確認メッセージが表示されるはずです。 Terraform を使用して他の作業も自動化できます。 例えば、Grafana provider はフォルダやダッシュボードの管理をサポートしています。 例えば、ダッシュボードを整理するためのフォルダを作成する場合： resource \"grafana_folder\" \"examplefolder\" { title = \"devops\" } さらに、example-dashboard.json というダッシュボードを上記のフォルダに作成する場合は、以下のスニペットを使用します： resource \"grafana_dashboard\" \"exampledashboard\" { folder = grafana_folder.examplefolder.id config_json = file(\"example-dashboard.json\") } Terraform は強力な自動化ツールであり、ここで示したように Grafana リソースの管理に使用できます。 注記 ただし、Terraform の状態 は、デフォルトではローカルで管理されることに注意してください。 つまり、Terraform を使用して共同作業を行う場合は、チーム間で状態を共有できる利用可能なオプションのいずれかを選択する必要があります。 クリーンアップ​ コンソールから Amazon

Grafana で使用する方法を説明します。 Amazon Athena は、標準 SQL を使用して Amazon S3 のデータを分析できるサーバーレスなインタラクティブクエリサービスです。 この統合は、Athena data source for Grafana によって実現されています。 これはオープンソースのプラグインで、任意の DIY Grafana インスタンスで使用できるほか、Amazon Managed Grafana にもプリインストールされています。 注記 このガイドは約 20 分で完了します。 前提条件​ 環境に AWS CLI がインストールされ、設定 されていること。 アカウントから Amazon Athena にアクセスできること。 インフラストラクチャ​ まず、必要なインフラストラクチャをセットアップしましょう。 Amazon Athena のセットアップ​ Athena を 2 つの異なるシナリオで使用する方法を見ていきます。1 つは Geomap プラグインを使用した地理データに関するシナリオ、もう 1 つは VPC フローログに関するセキュリティ関連のシナリオです。 まず、Athena がセットアップされ、データセットが読み込まれていることを確認しましょう。 警告 これらのクエリを実行するには、Amazon Athena コンソールを使用する必要があります。Grafana は一般的にデータソースへの読み取り専用アクセスのみを持つため、データの作成や更新には使用できません。 地理データの読み込み​ この最初のユースケースでは、Registry of Open Data on AWS のデータセットを使用します。 具体的には、地理データを使用したユースケースで Athena プラグインの使用方法を示すために、OpenStreetMap (OSM) を使用します。 これを実現するには、まず OSM データを Athena に取り込む必要があります。 まず、Athena で新しいデータベースを作成します。Athena コンソールに移動し、以下の 3 つの SQL クエリを使用して OSM データをデータベースにインポートします。 クエリ 1: CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE planet ( id BIGINT, type STRING, tags MAP<STRING,STRING>, lat DECIMAL(9,7), lon DECIMAL(10,7), nds ARRAY<STRUCT<ref: BIGINT>>, members ARRAY<STRUCT<type: STRING, ref: BIGINT, role: STRING>>, changeset BIGINT, timestamp TIMESTAMP, uid BIGINT, user STRING, version BIGINT ) STORED AS ORCFILE LOCATION 's3://osm-pds/planet/'; クエリ 2: CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE planet_history ( id BIGINT, type STRING, tags MAP<STRING,STRING>, lat DECIMAL(9,7), lon DECIMAL(10,7), nds ARRAY<STRUCT<ref: BIGINT>>, members ARRAY<STRUCT<type: STRING, ref: BIGINT, role: STRING>>, changeset BIGINT, timestamp TIMESTAMP, uid BIGINT, user STRING, version BIGINT, visible BOOLEAN ) STORED AS ORCFILE LOCATION 's3://osm-pds/planet-history/'; クエリ 3: CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE changesets ( id BIGINT, tags MAP<STRING,STRING>, created_at TIMESTAMP, open BOOLEAN, closed_at TIMESTAMP, comments_count BIGINT, min_lat DECIMAL(9,7), max_lat DECIMAL(9,7), min_lon DECIMAL(10,7), max_lon DECIMAL(10,7), num_changes BIGINT, uid BIGINT, user STRING ) STORED AS ORCFILE LOCATION 's3://osm-pds/changesets/'; VPC フローログデータの読み込み​ 2 番目のユースケースは、セキュリティに関連するものです。VPC Flow Logs を使用してネットワークトラフィックを分析します。 まず、EC2 に VPC フローログを生成するように指示する必要があります。 まだ設定していない場合は、VPC フローログを作成 してください。 ネットワークインターフェースレベル、サブネットレベル、または VPC レベルのいずれかで作成できます。 注記 クエリのパフォーマンスを向上させ、ストレージの使用量を最小限に抑えるため、VPC フローログはネストされたデータをサポートする列指向ストレージ形式である Parquet で保存します。 以下のように Parquet 形式で S3 バケットに公開する限り、どのオプション（ネットワークインターフェース、サブネット、または VPC）を選択しても構いません。 次に、Athena コンソール から、OSM データをインポートしたのと同じデータベースに VPC フローログデータのテーブルを作成します。 必要に応じて、新しいデータベースを作成することもできます。 以下の SQL クエリを使用し、VPC_FLOW_LOGS_LOCATION_IN_S3 を自分のバケット/フォルダに置き換えてください。 CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE vpclogs ( `version` int, `account_id` string, `interface_id` string, `srcaddr` string, `dstaddr` string, `srcport` int, `dstport` int, `protocol` bigint, `packets` bigint, `bytes` bigint, `start` bigint, `end` bigint, `action` string, `log_status` string, `vpc_id` string, `subnet_id` string, `instance_id` string, `tcp_flags` int, `type` string, `pkt_srcaddr` string, `pkt_dstaddr` string, `region` string, `az_id` string, `sublocation_type` string, `sublocation_id` string, `pkt_src_aws_service` string, `pkt_dst_aws_service` string, `flow_direction` string, `traffic_path` int ) STORED AS PARQUET LOCATION 'VPC_FLOW_LOGS_LOCATION_IN_S3' 例えば、S3 バケット allmyflowlogs を使用している場合、VPC_FLOW_LOGS_LOCATION_IN_S3 は以下のようになります。 s3://allmyflowlogs/AWSLogs/12345678901/vpcflowlogs/eu-west-1/2021/ これでデータセットが Athena で利用可能になりました。 次は Grafana に進みましょう。 Grafana のセットアップ​ Grafana インスタンスが必要なので、Getting Started ガイドを使用するなどして、新しい Amazon Managed Grafana ワークスペース をセットアップするか、既存のものを使用してください。 警告 AWS データソース設定を使用するには、まず Amazon Managed Grafana コンソールに移動し、ワークスペースに Athena リソースを読み取るために必要な IAM ポリシーを付与するサービスマネージド IAM ロールを有効にする必要があります。 さらに、以下の点に注意してください： 使用予定の Athena ワークグループには、サービスマネージドの権限でワークグループを使用できるようにするため、キー GrafanaDataSource と値 true のタグを付ける必要があります。 サービスマネージド IAM ポリシーは、grafana-athena-query-results- で始まるクエリ結果バケットへのアクセスのみを許可します。その他のバケットについては、手動で権限を追加する必要があります。 クエリ対象の基となるデータソースに対して、s3:Get* および s3:List* 権限を手動で追加する必要があります。 Athena データソースをセットアップするには、左側のツールバーを使用して、下部の AWS アイコンを選択し、「Athena」を選択します。 プラグインが使用する Athena データソースを検出するためのデフォルトリージョンを選択し、使用するアカウントを選択して、最後に「Add data source」を選択します。 または、以下の手順に従って Athena データソースを手動で追加および設定することもできます： 左側のツールバーの「Configurations」アイコンをクリックし、「Add data source」をクリックします。 「Athena」を検索します。 [オプション] 認証プロバイダーを設定します（推奨：ワークスペース IAM ロール）。 対象の Athena データソース、データベース、ワークグループを選択します。 ワークグループに出力場所がまだ設定されていない場合は、クエリ結果に使用する S3 バケットとフォルダを指定します。サービスマネージドポリシーを利用するには、バケット名が grafana-athena-query-results- で始まる必要があることに注意してください。 「Save & test」をクリックします。 以下のような画面が表示されるはずです： 使用方法​ それでは、Grafana から Athena のデータセットを使用する方法を見ていきましょう。 地理データの使用​ OpenStreetMap (OSM) のデータを Athena で使用することで、「特定の施設がどこにあるか」といった様々な質問に答えることができます。 実際に見てみましょう。 例えば、Las Vegas 地域で食事を提供する場所を一覧表示するために、OSM データセットに対して以下の SQL クエリを実行します： SELECT tags['amenity'] AS amenity, tags['name'] AS name, tags['website'] AS website, lat, lon FROM planet WHERE type = 'node' AND tags['amenity'] IN ('bar', 'pub', 'fast_food', 'restaurant') AND lon BETWEEN -115.5 AND -114.5 AND lat BETWEEN 36.1 AND 36.3 LIMIT 500; 備考 上記のクエリで定義されている Las Vegas 地域は、緯度が 36.1 から 36.3 の間、経度が -115.5 から -114.5 の間にある全ての場所です。 これらの値を変数化（各角に対して1つずつ）することで、Geomap プラグインを他の地域にも適用できるようになります。 上記のクエリを使用して OSM データを可視化するために、osm-sample-dashboard.json で提供されているサンプルダッシュボードをインポートできます。 以下のように表示されます： 注記 上記のスクリーンショットでは、データポイントをプロットするために Geomap 可視化（左パネル）を使用しています。 VPC フローログデータの使用​ VPC フローログデータを分析し、SSH および RDP トラフィックを検出するには、以下の SQL クエリを使用します。 SSH/RDP トラフィックの表形式の概要を取得する場合： SELECT srcaddr, dstaddr, account_id, action, protocol, bytes, log_status FROM vpclogs WHERE srcport in (22, 3389) OR dstport IN (22, 3389) ORDER BY start ASC; 許可および拒否されたバイト数の時系列ビューを取得する場合： SELECT from_unixtime(start), sum(bytes), action FROM vpclogs WHERE srcport in (22,3389) OR dstport IN (22, 3389) GROUP BY start, action ORDER BY start ASC; ヒント Athena でクエリするデータ量を制限したい場合は、$__timeFilter マクロの使用を検討してください。 VPC フローログデータを可視化するために、vpcfl-sample-dashboard.json で提供されているサンプルダッシュボードをインポートできます。 以下のようなダッシュボードが表示されます： ここから、以下のガイドを参照して Amazon

Scaling グループは、Amazon EC2 インスタンスの論理的なコレクションです。Auto Scaling グループは、事前に定義された起動テンプレートに基づいて EC2 インスタンスを起動できます。起動テンプレート には、AMI ID、インスタンスタイプ、ネットワーク設定、AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) インスタンスプロファイルなど、Amazon EC2 インスタンスの起動に使用される情報が含まれています。 Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling グループには、最小サイズ、最大サイズ、および希望容量 の概念があります。Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling は、Auto Scaling グループの現在の実行容量が希望容量を上回るか下回ると検出すると、必要に応じて自動的にスケールアウトまたはスケールインを行います。このスケーリングアプローチにより、容量とコストの両方に制限を設けながら、ワークロード内の弾力性を活用できます。 このソリューションを実証するために、2 つの Amazon EC2 インスタンスを含む Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling グループを作成しました。これらのインスタンスは、インスタンスメトリクスをリモートで書き込み、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus ワークスペースに送信します。Auto Scaling グループの最小サイズを 2（高可用性を維持するため）に設定し、グループの最大サイズを 10（コストを抑制するため）に設定しました。トラフィックが増加すると、負荷をサポートするために Amazon EC2 インスタンスが Auto Scaling グループの最大サイズまで自動的に追加されます。負荷が減少すると、Auto Scaling グループがグループの最小サイズに達するまで、それらの Amazon EC2 インスタンスは終了されます。このアプローチにより、クラウドの弾力性を活用してパフォーマンスの高いアプリケーションを実現できます。 リソースのスクレイピングが増えるにつれて、単一の Prometheus サーバーの能力を簡単に超えてしまう可能性があることに注意してください。この状況を回避するには、Prometheus サーバーをワークロードに合わせて線形にスケーリングします。このアプローチにより、必要な粒度でメトリクスデータを収集できます。 Prometheus ワークロードの Auto Scaling をサポートするために、以下のルールを持つ Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus ワークスペースを作成しました： YAML groups: - name: example rules: - alert: HostHighCpuLoad expr: 100 - (avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode=\"idle\"}[2m])) * 100) > 60 for: 5m labels: severity: warning event_type: scale_up annotations: summary: Host high CPU load (instance {{ $labels.instance }}) description: \"CPU load is > 60%\\n VALUE = {{ $value }}\\n LABELS = {{ $labels }}\" - alert: HostLowCpuLoad expr: 100 - (avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode=\"idle\"}[2m])) * 100) < 30 for: 5m labels: severity: warning event_type: scale_down annotations: summary: Host low CPU load (instance {{ $labels.instance }}) description: \"CPU load is < 30%\\n VALUE = {{ $value }}\\n LABELS = {{ $labels }}\" このルールセットは、HostHighCpuLoad と HostLowCpuLoad のルールを作成します。これらのアラートは、5 分間の CPU 使用率が 60% を超えるか、30% を下回った場合にトリガーされます。 アラートが発生すると、アラートマネージャーは alert_type（アラート名）と event_type（scale_down または scale_up）を含むメッセージを Amazon SNS トピックに転送します。 YAML alertmanager_config: | route: receiver: default_receiver repeat_interval: 5m receivers: - name: default_receiver sns_configs: - topic_arn: <ARN OF SNS TOPIC GOES HERE> send_resolved: false sigv4: region: us-east-1 message: | alert_type: {{ .CommonLabels.alertname }} event_type: {{ .CommonLabels.event_type }} AWS Lambda 関数が Amazon SNS トピックをサブスクライブしています。Lambda 関数には、Amazon SNS メッセージを検査して scale_up または scale_down イベントを判断するロジックを実装しています。その後、Lambda 関数は Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling グループの希望容量を増減します。Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling グループは容量の変更要求を検出し、Amazon EC2 インスタンスを起動または終了します。 Auto Scaling をサポートする Lambda コードは以下の通りです： Python import json import boto3 import os def lambda_handler(event, context): print(event) msg = event['Records'][0]['Sns']['Message'] scale_type = '' if msg.find('scale_up') > -1: scale_type = 'scale_up' else: scale_type = 'scale_down' get_desired_instance_count(scale_type) def get_desired_instance_count(scale_type): client = boto3.client('autoscaling') asg_name = os.environ['ASG_NAME'] response = client.describe_auto_scaling_groups(AutoScalingGroupNames=[ asg_name]) minSize = response['AutoScalingGroups'][0]['MinSize'] maxSize = response['AutoScalingGroups'][0]['MaxSize'] desiredCapacity = response['AutoScalingGroups'][0]['DesiredCapacity'] if scale_type == \"scale_up\": desiredCapacity = min(desiredCapacity+1, maxSize) if scale_type == \"scale_down\": desiredCapacity = max(desiredCapacity - 1, minSize) print('Scale type: {}; new capacity: {}'.format(scale_type, desiredCapacity)) response = client.set_desired_capacity(AutoScalingGroupName=asg_name, DesiredCapacity=desiredCapacity, HonorCooldown=False) 完全なアーキテクチャは以下の図で確認できます。 ソリューションのテスト​ AWS CloudFormation テンプレートを起動して、このソリューションを自動的にプロビジョニングできます。 スタックの前提条件： Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) アウトバウンドトラフィックを許可する AWS セキュリティグループ Download Launch Stack Template リンクを選択して、アカウントでテンプレートをダウンロードしてセットアップします。設定プロセスの一部として、Amazon EC2 インスタンスに関連付けるサブネットとセキュリティグループを指定する必要があります。詳細は次の図を参照してください。 ## Download Launch Stack Template これは CloudFormation スタックの詳細画面で、スタック名は prometheus-autoscale に設定されています。スタックのパラメータには、Prometheus の Linux インストーラーの URL、Prometheus の Linux Node Exporter の URL、ソリューションで使用されるサブネットとセキュリティグループ、使用する AMI とインスタンスタイプ、Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling グループの最大容量が含まれています。 スタックのデプロイには約 8 分かかります。完了すると、作成された Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling グループ内で 2 つの Amazon EC2 インスタンスがデプロイされ、実行されていることがわかります。Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus Alert Manager を介した自動スケーリングのソリューションを検証するために、AWS Systems Manager Run Command と AWSFIS-Run-CPU-Stress 自動化ドキュメント を使用して Amazon EC2 インスタンスに負荷をかけます。 Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling グループの CPU にストレスがかかると、Alert Manager がこれらのアラートを発行し、Lambda 関数が Auto Scaling グループをスケールアップすることで応答します。CPU 使用率が低下すると、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus ワークスペースで CPU 低下アラートが発生し、Alert Manager がアラートを Amazon SNS トピックに発行し、Lambda 関数が Auto Scaling グループをスケールダウンすることで応答します。これは次の図で示されています。 Grafana ダッシュボードには、CPU が 100% までスパイクしたことを示す線があります。CPU が高くなっていますが、別の線はインスタンス数が 2 から 10 に段階的に増加したことを示しています。CPU が低下すると、インスタンス数は徐々に 2 まで減少します。 コスト​ Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus は、取り込まれたメトリクス、保存されたメトリクス、クエリされたメトリクスに基づいて料金が設定されています。最新の料金と料金例については、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus の料金ページをご覧ください。 Amazon SNS は、月間の API リクエスト数に基づいて料金が設定されています。Amazon SNS と Lambda 間のメッセージ配信は無料ですが、Amazon SNS と Lambda 間のデータ転送量に対して料金が発生します。最新の Amazon SNS の料金詳細をご覧ください。 Lambda は、関数の実行時間と関数へのリクエスト数に基づいて料金が設定されています。最新の AWS Lambda の料金詳細をご覧ください。 Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling の使用には追加料金はかかりません。 まとめ​ Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus、Alert Manager、Amazon SNS、Lambda を使用することで、Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling グループのスケーリングアクティビティを制御できます。このソリューションでは、Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling を活用しながら、既存の Prometheus ワークロードを AWS に移行する方法を示しています。アプリケーションの負荷が増加すると、需要に応じてシームレスにスケールします。 この例では、Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling グループは CPU に基づいてスケールしましたが、ワークロードからの任意の Prometheus メトリクスに対して同様のアプローチを取ることができます。このアプローチにより、スケーリングアクションをきめ細かく制御でき、ビジネス価値が最も高いメトリクスに基づいてワークロードをスケールできます。 以前のブログ記事では、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus Alert Manager を使用して PagerDuty でアラートを受信する方法 や、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus を Slack と統合する方法 についても説明しました。これらのソリューションは、最も有用な方法でワークスペースからアラートを受信する方法を示しています。 次のステップとして、Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus 用の独自のルール設定ファイルを作成し、独自のアラートレシーバーをセットアップする方法を確認してください。さらに、Alert Manager 内で使用できるアラートルールの優れた例については、Awesome Prometheus alerts をご覧ください。 このページを編集 ソリューション概要 ソリューションのテスト コスト まとめ","s":"Amazon Managed

の説明に従って、Incoming Webhooks を有効にしてください。 ワークスペースを設定したら、Grafana ダッシュボードで使用する webhook URL を取得できるようになります。 AMG でアラートを設定する​ メトリクスがしきい値を超えた場合に Grafana アラートを設定できます。AMG では、ダッシュボードでアラートの評価頻度を設定し、通知を送信することができます。この例では、Azure 仮想マシンの CPU 使用率に対するアラートを設定します。使用率がしきい値を超えた場合、両方のチャネルに通知を送信するように AMG を設定します。 ダッシュボードで、ドロップダウンから CPU 使用率を選択し、[Edit] を選択します。グラフパネルの [Alert] タブで、アラートルールの評価頻度と、アラートの状態を変更して通知を開始するための条件を設定します。 以下の設定では、CPU 使用率が 50% を超えた場合にアラートが作成されます。通知は grafana-alert-notification チャネルと slack-alert-notification チャネルの両方に送信されます。 これで、Azure 仮想マシンにサインインし、stress などのツールを使用してストレステストを開始できます。CPU 使用率がしきい値を超えると、両方のチャネルで通知を受け取ることができます。 次に、適切なしきい値で CPU 使用率のアラートを設定し、Slack チャネルに送信されるアラートをシミュレートします。 まとめ​ このレシピでは、AMG ワークスペースのデプロイ、通知チャネルの設定、Azure Cloud からのメトリクスの収集、AMG

リモートライトエンドポイントを通じて AMP に取り込むように設定されています。 備考 AMP の Prometheus Remote Write Exporter の詳細については、 Getting Started with Prometheus Remote Write Exporter for AMP をご覧ください。 前提条件​ 環境に AWS CLI がインストールされ、設定されていること。 環境に eksctl コマンドをインストールする必要があります。 環境に kubectl をインストールする必要があります。 環境に Docker がインストールされていること。 AWS アカウントで AMP ワークスペースが設定されていること。 Helm をインストールする必要があります。 AWS-SSO を有効にする必要があります。 EKS クラスターのセットアップ​ まず、サンプルアプリケーションを実行するために App Mesh を有効にした EKS クラスターを作成します。 eksctl CLI を使用して、eks-cluster-config.yaml でクラスターをデプロイします。 このテンプレートは、EKS で新しいクラスターを作成します。 テンプレートファイルを編集し、AMP が利用可能な以下のリージョンのいずれかを設定してください： us-east-1 us-east-2 us-west-2 eu-central-1 eu-west-1 セッションでこのリージョンを上書きしてください。例えば、Bash シェルでは以下のようにします： export AWS_REGION=eu-west-1 以下のコマンドを使用してクラスターを作成します： eksctl create cluster -f eks-cluster-config.yaml これにより、AMP-EKS-CLUSTER という名前の EKS クラスターと、EKS の App Mesh コントローラーが使用する appmesh-controller という名前のサービスアカウントが作成されます。 App Mesh Controller のインストール​ 次に、以下のコマンドを実行して App Mesh Controller をインストールし、カスタムリソース定義 (CRD) を設定します。 helm repo add eks https://aws.github.io/eks-charts helm upgrade -i appmesh-controller eks/appmesh-controller \\ --namespace appmesh-system \\ --set region=${AWS_REGION} \\ --set serviceAccount.create=false \\ --set serviceAccount.name=appmesh-controller AMP のセットアップ​ AMP ワークスペースは、Envoy から収集された Prometheus メトリクスを取り込むために使用されます。 ワークスペースは、テナント専用の論理的な Cortex サーバーです。 ワークスペースは、更新、一覧表示、説明、削除などの管理操作の認可、およびメトリクスの取り込みとクエリに対して、きめ細かなアクセス制御をサポートしています。 AWS CLI を使用してワークスペースを作成します： aws amp create-workspace --alias AMP-APPMESH --region $AWS_REGION 必要な Helm リポジトリを追加します： helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts && \\ helm repo add kube-state-metrics https://kubernetes.github.io/kube-state-metrics AMP の詳細については、AMP Getting started ガイドを参照してください。 メトリクスのスクレイピングと取り込み​ AMP は、Kubernetes クラスター内のコンテナ化されたワークロードから運用メトリクスを直接スクレイプすることはできません。 この作業を実行するには、Prometheus サーバーまたは AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector や Grafana Agent などの OpenTelemetry エージェントをデプロイして管理する必要があります。 このレシピでは、Grafana Agent を設定して Envoy メトリクスをスクレイプし、AMP と AMG を使用して分析する手順を説明します。 Grafana Agent の設定​ Grafana Agent は、完全な Prometheus サーバーを実行する代替となる軽量なソリューションです。 Prometheus エクスポーターの検出とスクレイピング、および Prometheus 互換のバックエンドへのメトリクスの送信に必要な部分を維持します。 また、Grafana Agent には AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) 認証のための AWS Signature Version 4 (Sigv4) のネイティブサポートも含まれています。 ここでは、Prometheus メトリクスを AMP に送信するための IAM ロールを設定する手順を説明します。 EKS クラスターに Grafana Agent をインストールし、メトリクスを AMP に転送します。 アクセス許可の設定​ Grafana Agent は、EKS クラスターで実行されているコンテナ化されたワークロードから運用メトリクスを収集し、AMP に送信します。 AMP に送信されるデータは、マネージドサービスの各クライアントリクエストを認証および承認するために、Sigv4 を使用して有効な AWS 認証情報で署名する必要があります。 Grafana Agent は、Kubernetes サービスアカウントの ID で実行されるように EKS クラスターにデプロイできます。 IAM ロールをサービスアカウント (IRSA) で使用することで、IAM ロールを Kubernetes サービスアカウントに関連付け、そのサービスアカウントを使用する Pod に IAM アクセス許可を付与できます。 以下のように IRSA のセットアップを準備します： kubectl create namespace grafana-agent export WORKSPACE=$(aws amp list-workspaces | jq -r '.workspaces[] | select(.alias==\"AMP-APPMESH\").workspaceId') export ROLE_ARN=$(aws iam get-role --role-name EKS-GrafanaAgent-AMP-ServiceAccount-Role --query Role.Arn --output text) export NAMESPACE=\"grafana-agent\" export REMOTE_WRITE_URL=\"https://aps-workspaces.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/workspaces/$WORKSPACE/api/v1/remote_write\" gca-permissions.sh シェルスクリプトを使用して、以下の手順を自動化できます（プレースホルダー変数 YOUR_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME を EKS クラスターの名前に置き換えてください）： AMP ワークスペースへのリモート書き込み権限を持つ IAM ポリシーを含む EKS-GrafanaAgent-AMP-ServiceAccount-Role という名前の IAM ロールを作成します。 IAM ロールに関連付けられた grafana-agent 名前空間の下に grafana-agent という名前の Kubernetes サービスアカウントを作成します。 IAM ロールと Amazon EKS クラスターでホストされている OIDC プロバイダー間の信頼関係を作成します。 gca-permissions.sh スクリプトを実行するには、kubectl と eksctl の CLI ツールが必要です。 これらは Amazon EKS クラスターにアクセスできるように設定されている必要があります。 次に、Envoy メトリクスを抽出するスクレイプ設定を含むマニフェストファイル grafana-agent.yaml を作成し、Grafana Agent をデプロイします。 注記 執筆時点では、Fargate 上の EKS ではデーモンセットがサポートされていないため、このソリューションは機能しません。 この例では、grafana-agent という名前のデーモンセットと grafana-agent-deployment という名前のデプロイメントをデプロイします。 grafana-agent デーモンセットはクラスター上の Pod からメトリクスを収集し、grafana-agent-deployment デプロイメントは EKS コントロールプレーンなど、クラスター上に存在しないサービスからメトリクスを収集します。 kubectl apply -f grafana-agent.yaml grafana-agent がデプロイされると、メトリクスを収集し、指定された AMP ワークスペースに取り込みます。 次に、EKS クラスターにサンプルアプリケーションをデプロイし、メトリクスの分析を開始します。 サンプルアプリケーション​ アプリケーションをインストールし Envoy コンテナを注入するために、Kubernetes 用の AppMesh コントローラーを使用します。 まず、サンプルリポジトリをクローンしてベースアプリケーションをインストールします： git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-app-mesh-examples.git 次に、クラスターにリソースを適用します： kubectl apply -f aws-app-mesh-examples/examples/apps/djapp/1_base_application Pod のステータスを確認し、実行中であることを確認します： $ kubectl -n prod get all NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/dj-cb77484d7-gx9vk 1/1 Running 0 6m8s pod/jazz-v1-6b6b6dd4fc-xxj9s 1/1 Running 0 6m8s pod/metal-v1-584b9ccd88-kj7kf 1/1 Running 0 6m8s 次に、App Mesh コントローラーをインストールし、デプロイメントをメッシュ化します： kubectl apply -f aws-app-mesh-examples/examples/apps/djapp/2_meshed_application/ kubectl rollout restart deployment -n prod dj jazz-v1 metal-v1 これで、各 Pod で 2 つのコンテナが実行されているのが確認できます： $ kubectl -n prod get all NAME

jazz.prod.svc.cluster.local:9080 ; echo ; loop_counter=$[$loop_counter+1] ; \\ done AMG ワークスペースの作成​ AMG ワークスペースを作成するには、Getting Started with AMG のブログ記事の手順に従ってください。 ダッシュボードへのユーザーアクセスを許可するには、AWS SSO を有効にする必要があります。 ワークスペースの作成後、個々のユーザーまたはユーザーグループに Grafana ワークスペースへのアクセスを割り当てることができます。 デフォルトでは、ユーザータイプは viewer です。 ユーザーロールに基づいてユーザータイプを変更してください。 AMP ワークスペースをデータソースとして追加し、ダッシュボードの作成を開始します。 この例では、ユーザー名は grafana-admin、ユーザータイプは Admin です。 必要なデータソースを選択します。 設定を確認し、Create workspace を選択します。 AMG データソースの設定​ AMG で AMP をデータソースとして設定するには、Data sources セクションで Configure in Grafana を選択します。これにより、ブラウザで Grafana ワークスペースが起動します。 また、ブラウザで Grafana ワークスペースの URL を手動で起動することもできます。 スクリーンショットからわかるように、ダウンストリームのレイテンシー、接続数、レスポンスコードなどの Envoy メトリクスを表示できます。 表示されているフィルターを使用して、特定のアプリケーションの Envoy メトリクスを詳しく調べることができます。 AMG ダッシュボードの設定​ データソースの設定が完了したら、カスタムダッシュボードをインポートして Envoy メトリクスを分析します。 ここでは事前に定義されたダッシュボードを使用するため、以下に示すように Import を選択し、ID 11022 を入力します。 これにより Envoy Global ダッシュボードがインポートされ、Envoy メトリクスの分析を開始できます。 AMG でアラートを設定する​ メトリクスが意図した閾値を超えた場合に Grafana アラートを設定できます。 AMG では、ダッシュボードでアラートの評価頻度を設定し、通知を送信することができます。 アラートルールを作成する前に、通知チャネルを作成する必要があります。 この例では、Amazon SNS を通知チャネルとして設定します。 サービスマネージド権限 のデフォルト設定を使用する場合、通知を正常にトピックに発行するには、SNS トピックの名前に grafana というプレフィックスを付ける必要があります。 以下のコマンドを使用して、grafana-notification という名前の SNS トピックを作成します： aws sns create-topic --name grafana-notification そして、メールアドレスでサブスクライブします。 以下のコマンドでリージョンとアカウント ID を指定してください： aws sns subscribe \\ --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:<region>:<account-id>:grafana-notification \\ --protocol email \\ --notification-endpoint <email-id> 次に、Grafana ダッシュボードから新しい通知チャネルを追加します。 grafana-notification という名前の新しい通知チャネルを設定します。 Type には、ドロップダウンから AWS SNS を選択します。 Topic には、作成した SNS トピックの ARN を使用します。 Auth provider には、AWS SDK Default を選択します。 次に、1 分間のダウンストリームレイテンシーが 5 ミリ秒を超えた場合のアラートを設定します。 ダッシュボードで、ドロップダウンから Downstream latency を選択し、Edit を選択します。 グラフパネルの Alert タブで、アラートルールの評価頻度と、アラートの状態を変更して通知を開始するための条件を設定します。 以下の設定では、ダウンストリームレイテンシーが閾値を超えた場合にアラートが作成され、設定された grafana-alert-notification チャネルを通じて SNS トピックに通知が送信されます。 クリーンアップ​ リソースとクラスターを削除します: kubectl delete all --all eksctl delete cluster --name AMP-EKS-CLUSTER

つのタイプがあります。 アプリケーションのソースコードなど、インストルメンテーションを通じて制御できるもの。 マネージドサービスなど、(直接的な) 制御下にないその他のもの。 このタイプのソースは通常、AWS によって提供され、API を通じてシグナルを公開します。 エージェント​ シグナルをソースから送信先に転送するには、エージェントと呼ばれる仲介役が必要です。

アラームとは、プローブ、モニター、または特定のしきい値を超えた（または下回った）値の変化の状態を指します。シンプルな例として、ディスクが一杯になった時やウェブサイトがダウンした時にメールを送信するアラームがあります。より高度なアラームは完全にプログラム化されており、自動スケーリングやサーバークラスター全体の作成などの複雑な相互作用を駆動するために使用されます。 ただし、ユースケースに関係なく、アラームはメトリクスの現在の 状態 を示します。この状態は、対象のシステムに応じて OK、WARNING、ALERT、または NO DATA となります。 アラームは一定期間この状態を反映し、時系列データの上に構築されています。そのため、時系列データ から 派生したものです。以下のグラフは 2 つのアラームを示しています：1 つは警告しきい値を持つアラーム、もう 1 つはこの時系列データの平均値を示すアラームです。このトラフィック量が示すように、警告しきい値のアラームは、定義された値を下回った時に違反状態になるはずです。 備考 アラームの目的は、アクション（人的またはプログラム的）をトリガーすること、またはしきい値違反の情報を提供することです。アラームはメトリクスのパフォーマンスに関する洞察を提供します。 アクションにつながるものにアラートを設定する​ アラーム疲れとは、人々があまりにも多くのアラートを受け取るため、それらを無視するようになってしまう状態です。これは適切にモニタリングされているシステムの特徴ではありません！むしろ、これはアンチパターンです。 備考 アクションにつながるものにアラームを作成し、常に目的から逆算して考える必要があります。 例えば、迅速なレスポンスタイムが必要な Web サイトを運用している場合、レスポンスタイムが特定のしきい値を超えた時にアラートを送信するように設定します。また、パフォーマンスの低下が CPU 使用率の上昇と関連していることが分かっている場合は、問題が発生する前に 事前に このデータポイントでアラートを設定します。しかし、目的に 影響を与えない 場合は、環境内の すべての CPU 使用率についてアラートを設定する必要はないかもしれません。 備考 アラームがアラートを必要としない、または自動化プロセスをトリガーする必要がない場合、アラートを設定する必要はありません。不要なアラームからは通知を削除するべきです。 「すべて OK アラーム」に注意​ 同様に、一般的なパターンとして「すべて OK アラーム」があります。これは、オペレーターが常に警告を受け取ることに慣れすぎて、突然警告が来なくなった時だけ気付くという状態です！ これは非常に危険な運用モードであり、オペレーショナルエクセレンスに反するパターンです。 警告 「すべて OK アラーム」は通常、人による解釈が必要です！このため、自己修復アプリケーションのようなパターンが実現できなくなります。1 アラーム疲れを集約で解消する​ オブザーバビリティは技術的な問題ではなく、人間 の問題です。そのため、アラーム戦略は、アラームを増やすのではなく、削減することに重点を置くべきです。テレメトリ収集を実装すると、環境からより多くのアラートが発生するのは自然なことです。ただし、アクション可能な事象のみにアラートを設定する よう注意してください。アラートの原因となった状態にアクションを取れない場合、それを報告する必要はありません。 これは例を見るとよく分かります。5 台の Web サーバーがバックエンドに単一のデータベースを使用している場合、データベースがダウンすると Web サーバーはどうなるでしょうか？多くの場合、Web サーバーに対して 5 つ 、データベースに対して 1 つ 、少なくとも 6 つ のアラートが発生します！ しかし、実際に意味のあるアラートは 2 つだけです： Web サイトがダウンしている データベースが原因である 備考 アラートを集約して本質的な情報に絞り込むことで、人々が理解しやすくなり、ランブックや自動化の作成も容易になります。 既存の ITSM とサポートプロセスを活用する​ モニタリングとオブザーバビリティのプラットフォームに関係なく、それらは現在のツールチェーンと統合する必要があります。 備考 アラートからこれらのツールへのプログラムによる統合を使用してトラブルチケットや課題を作成し、人的作業を削減しプロセスを効率化します。 これにより、DORA メトリクス などの重要な運用データを取得できます。 Footnotes​

ログは、アプリケーションやアプライアンスから送信される一連のメッセージで、イベントに関する詳細や、時にはアプリケーションの健全性について、1 行以上の詳細情報で表されます。 通常、ログはファイルに出力されますが、分析や集計を行うコレクターに送信される場合もあります。 1 日あたり数メガバイトから 1 時間あたり数テラバイトまで、あらゆる量のログデータの生成、取り込み、管理を容易にすることを目的とした、多くの機能を備えたログアグリゲーター、フレームワーク、製品が存在します。 ログは一度に 1 つのアプリケーションから出力され、通常は 1 つのアプリケーション のスコープに関連しています。ただし、開発者は必要に応じて、複雑で細かなログを自由に設定できます。 ここでは、ログは トレース とは根本的に異なるシグナルと考えています。トレースは、複数のアプリケーションやサービスからのイベントで構成され、レスポンスレイテンシー、サービス障害、リクエストパラメータなど、サービス間の接続に関するコンテキストを含みます。 ログのデータは、一定期間にわたって集計することもできます。 例えば、統計的なデータ (前の 1 分間に処理されたリクエスト数など) を含めることができます。 構造化されたデータ、自由形式のデータ、詳細なデータ、あらゆる言語で記述できます。 ログの主な使用例は、以下を説明することです。 イベントの状態、期間、その他の重要な統計情報 そのイベントに関連するエラーや警告 (スタックトレース、タイムアウトなど) アプリケーションの起動、開始、シャットダウンメッセージ 注記 ログは イミュータブル(不変性) であることを意図しており、多くのログ管理システムには、ログデータの改ざんを防止し、検出するメカニズムが含まれています。 ログに関する要件に関係なく、以下は私たちが特定したベストプラクティスです。 構造化ログは成功の鍵​ 多くのシステムは、半構造化された形式でログを出力します。例えば、Apache Web サーバーは、1 行が 1 つの Web リクエストに対応する以下のようなログを出力します： 192.168.2.20 - - [28/Jul/2006:10:27:10 -0300] \"GET /cgi-bin/try/ HTTP/1.0\" 200 3395 127.0.0.1 - - [28/Jul/2006:10:22:04 -0300] \"GET / HTTP/1.0\" 200 2216 一方、Java のスタックトレースは、複数行にまたがる 1 つのイベントで、より構造化されていない形式です： Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerException at com.example.myproject.Book.getTitle(Book.java:16) at com.example.myproject.Author.getBookTitles(Author.java:25) at com.example.myproject.Bootstrap.main(Bootstrap.java:14) また、Python のエラーログイベントは以下のように表示されます： Traceback (most recent call last): File \"e.py\", line 7, in <module> raise TypeError(\"Again !?!\") TypeError: Again !?! これら 3 つの例のうち、最初の例だけが人間 と ログ集約システムの両方で簡単に解析できます。構造化ログを使用することで、ログデータを迅速かつ効果的に処理でき、人間とマシンの両方が必要な情報をすぐに見つけることができます。 最も一般的に理解されているログ形式は JSON で、イベントの各コンポーネントがキーと値のペアとして表現されます。JSON では、上記の Python の例は以下のように書き換えることができます： { \"level\", \"ERROR\" \"file\": \"e.py\", \"line\": 7, \"error\": \"TypeError(\\\"Again !?!\\\")\" } 構造化ログを使用することで、データを異なるログシステム間で移行しやすくなり、開発が簡素化され、運用上の診断が迅速に（かつエラーが少なく）行えるようになります。また、JSON を使用することで、実際のデータと共にログメッセージのスキーマが埋め込まれ、高度なログ分析システムがメッセージを自動的にインデックス化できるようになります。 ログレベルを適切に使用する​ ログには、レベル を持つものとイベントのシリーズの 2 種類があります。レベルを持つログは、成功的なロギング戦略の重要なコンポーネントです。ログレベルはフレームワークによって若干異なりますが、一般的に以下のような構造になっています： レベル 説明 DEBUG アプリケーションのデバッグに最も役立つ、きめ細かな情報イベントです。これらは通常、開発者にとって価値があり、非常に詳細です。 INFO アプリケーションの進行状況を粗いレベルで示す情報メッセージです。 WARN アプリケーションにリスクを示す、潜在的に有害な状況です。これらはアプリケーションでアラームを発生させる可能性があります。 ERROR アプリケーションの実行は継続できるものの、エラーが発生しているイベントです。これらは注意が必要なアラームを発生させる可能性が高いです。 FATAL アプリケーションの中断を引き起こす可能性がある、非常に深刻なエラーイベントです。 備考 明示的なレベルを持たないログは暗黙的に INFO とみなされますが、この動作はアプリケーションによって異なる場合があります。 その他の一般的なログレベルには、ニーズ、プログラミング言語、フレームワークに応じて CRITICAL や NONE があります。ALL と NONE も一般的ですが、すべてのアプリケーションスタックで見られるわけではありません。 ログレベルは、環境の健全性についてモニタリングとオブザーバビリティソリューションに知らせるために重要であり、ログデータは論理的な値を使用してこのデータを容易に表現する必要があります。 ヒント WARN レベルで多くのデータをログに記録すると、価値の限られたデータでモニタリングシステムが満杯になり、大量のメッセージの中で重要なデータが失われる可能性があります。 備考 標準化されたログレベル戦略を使用することで、自動化が容易になり、開発者が問題の根本原因をすばやく特定できるようになります。 警告 ログレベルに対する標準的なアプローチがないと、ログのフィルタリング が大きな課題となります。 ソースに近い場所でログをフィルタリング​ 可能な限り、ソースに近い場所でログの量を削減してください。このベストプラクティスには以下のような理由があります： ログの取り込みには常に時間、コスト、リソースがかかります。 機密データ（個人を特定できるデータなど）を下流のシステムでフィルタリングすることで、データ漏洩のリスクを軽減できます。 下流のシステムは、データソースと同じ運用上の懸念事項を持っているとは限りません。例えば、アプリケーションの INFO ログは、CRITCAL や FATAL メッセージを監視するモニタリングおよびアラートシステムにとって重要ではない場合があります。 ログシステムやネットワークに過度の負荷やトラフィックをかける必要はありません。 備考 コストを抑え、データ露出のリスクを減らし、各コンポーネントを重要な事項に集中させるため、ソースに近い場所でログをフィルタリングしてください。 ヒント アーキテクチャによっては、Infrastructure as Code (IaC) を使用してアプリケーションと環境の変更を一度の操作でデプロイすることをお勧めします。このアプローチでは、ログフィルターパターンをアプリケーションと共にデプロイでき、同じ厳密さと扱いを適用できます。 二重取り込みのアンチパターンを避ける​ 管理者がよく採用するパターンとして、1 つの場所からすべてのログを照会することを目的に、すべてのログデータを単一のシステムにコピーするというものがあります。 これには手作業のワークフローにおいて利点がありますが、このパターンは追加のコスト、複雑さ、障害ポイント、運用オーバーヘッドを引き起こします。 備考 可能な限り、ログレベル と ログフィルタリング を組み合わせて使用し、環境からのログデータの一括伝播を避けてください。 備考 組織や業務によっては、規制要件を満たす、ログを安全な場所に保存する、否認防止を提供する、その他の目的を達成するために、ログシッピング が必要な場合があります。 これはログデータを再取り込みする一般的なユースケースです。 これらのログアーカイブに入る不要なデータの量を減らすために、ログレベル と ログフィルタリング を適切に適用することは依然として重要です。 ログからメトリクスデータを収集する​ ログには収集を待っているメトリクスが含まれています！ISV ソリューションや自分で作成していないアプリケーションでさえ、ワークロードの全体的な健全性について意味のある洞察を得られる貴重なデータをログに出力します。一般的な例として以下のようなものがあります： データベースからの低速クエリ時間 Web サーバーのアップタイム トランザクション処理時間 時間経過による ERROR や WARNING イベントの数 アップグレード可能なパッケージの実数 ヒント 静的なログファイルにロックされているデータは、あまり有用ではありません。ベストプラクティスは、重要なメトリクスデータを特定し、他のシグナルと相関付けができるメトリクスシステムに公開することです。 stdout へのログ出力​ 可能な限り、アプリケーションはファイルやソケットなどの固定された場所ではなく、stdout にログを出力するべきです。これにより、ログエージェントはオブザーバビリティソリューションに適したルールに基づいてログイベントを収集およびルーティングできます。すべてのアプリケーションで実現できるわけではありませんが、これはコンテナ化されたワークロードのベストプラクティスです。 注記 アプリケーションはログ記録の実践においてシンプルで汎用的であり、ログソリューションとの結合を緩やかに保つべきですが、ログデータの送信には依然として stdout からファイルにデータを送信するログコレクターが必要です。重要な概念は、アプリケーションとビジネスロジックがログインフラストラクチャに依存しないようにすることです。つまり、関心の分離を実現するように努めるべきです。 備考 アプリケーションをログ管理から切り離すことで、コードの変更なしにソリューションを適応・進化させることができ、環境に加えられた変更の Blast Radius を最小限に抑えることができます。 このページを編集 次へ メトリクス 構造化ログは成功の鍵 ログレベルを適切に使用する ソースに近い場所でログをフィルタリング 二重取り込みのアンチパターンを避ける ログからメトリクスデータを収集する

最近では、多くのアーキテクチャがイベント駆動型になっています。イベント駆動型アーキテクチャでは、イベントは異なるシステムからのシグナルであり、それを捕捉して他のシステムに渡します。イベントは通常、状態の変更または更新を表します。 例えば、e コマースシステムでは、商品がカートに追加されたときにイベントが発生する可能性があります。このイベントを捕捉し、システムのショッピングカート部分に渡して、商品の詳細とともにカート内のアイテム数と合計金額を更新することができます。 備考 一部のお客様にとって、イベントは購入完了などの マイルストーン である場合があります。ワークフローの完了時点を集約してイベントとして扱うという考え方もありますが、ここではマイルストーン自体をイベントとは考えません。 イベントが有用な理由​ オブザーバビリティソリューションにおいて、イベントが有用な主な方法は 2 つあります。1 つは他のデータのコンテキストでイベントを可視化すること、もう 1 つはイベントに基づいてアクションを実行できるようにすることです。 備考 イベントは、ワークロードの変更やアクションについて、人間やマシンに価値のある情報を提供することを目的としています。 イベントの可視化​ アプリケーションから直接得られるものではありませんが、アプリケーションのパフォーマンスに影響を与えたり、根本原因の分析に役立つイベントシグナルが多数存在します。 ダッシュボードはイベントを可視化する最も一般的な手段ですが、分析やビジネスインテリジェンスツールもこの目的で使用できます。 メールやインスタントメッセージングアプリケーションでも、容易に可視化結果を受け取ることができます。 Web フロントエンドでの注文処理時間など、アプリケーションのパフォーマンスを示す時系列チャートを考えてみましょう。 時系列チャートを見ると、数日前にレスポンスタイムが段階的に変化したことがわかります。 最近のデプロイメントの状況を知ることができれば有用かもしれません。 最近のデプロイメントの時系列チャートを並べて表示したり、同じチャート上に重ねて表示したりすることを検討してみてはいかがでしょうか？ ヒント より広い文脈を理解するために、どのようなイベントが有用かを検討してください。 重要なイベントとしては、コードのデプロイメント、インフラストラクチャの変更イベント、新しいデータの追加（販売する新商品の公開や、ユーザーの一括追加など）、機能の変更や追加（カートへの商品追加方法の変更など）が考えられます。 備考 重要なメトリクスデータと共にイベントを可視化することで、イベントの相関関係を把握することができます。 イベントに対するアクション​ オブザーバビリティの世界では、アラームのトリガーは一般的なイベントです。このイベントには、アラームの識別子、アラームの状態（IN ALARM や OK など）、トリガーの詳細が含まれます。多くの場合、このアラームイベントが検出され、メール通知が送信されます。これはアラームに対するアクションの一例です。 アラーム通知はオブザーバビリティにおいて重要です。これにより、問題が発生した際に適切な担当者に通知することができます。しかし、オブザーバビリティソリューションでイベントに対するアクションが成熟すると、人の介入なしに問題を自動的に修復することができます。 どのようなアクションを取るべきか？​ 検出された問題を緩和するためのアクションを理解せずに、自動化することはできません。 オブザーバビリティの取り組みを始めた段階では、多くの場合それは明確ではありません。 しかし、問題の修復経験を積むほど、既知のアクションが必要な領域を捉えるようにアラームを微調整できるようになります。 アラームサービスに組み込まれたアクションがある場合もあれば、アラームイベントを自身でキャプチャしてスクリプトで解決する必要がある場合もあります。 備考 水平 Pod 自動スケーリング などの自動スケーリングシステムは、このプリンシパルの実装に過ぎません。 Kubernetes は単にこの自動化を抽象化しているだけです。 アラームの頻度と解決に関するデータにアクセスできれば、自動化の可能性を判断するのに役立ちます。 問題の症状に基づく広範囲のアラームは問題の検出に優れていますが、自動修復とリンクさせるにはより具体的な基準が必要になる場合があります。 これを行う際は、インシデント管理/チケット発行/ITSM ツールとの統合を検討してください。 多くの組織では、インシデントとそれに関連する解決策、平均解決時間 (MTTR) などのメトリクスを追跡しています。 これを行う場合は、自動化された 解決策も同様の方法で記録することを検討してください。 これにより、自動的に修復される問題の種類と割合を理解できるだけでなく、根本的なパターンや問題を探ることもできます。 ヒント 誰かが手動で問題を修正する必要がなかったからといって、根本的な原因を調査しなくてよいわけではありません。 例えば、サーバーが応答しなくなるたびに再起動する場合を考えてみましょう。 再起動によってシステムは機能し続けることができますが、応答しなくなる原因は何でしょうか。 これがどのくらいの頻度で発生するか、そしてパターン（レポート生成、ユーザー数の増加、システムバックアップなどと一致する）があるかどうかによって、根本原因の理解と修正に投入する優先順位とリソースが決まります。 備考 重要業績評価指標 に関連するすべてのイベントをメッセージバスに配信して使用することを検討してください。 また、一部のオブザーバビリティソリューションでは、明示的な設定要件なしにこれを透過的に行うことに注意してください。 オブザーバビリティプラットフォームへのイベントの取り込み​ 重要なイベントを特定したら、それらをオブザーバビリティプラットフォームに取り込む最適な方法を検討する必要があります。 プラットフォームには、イベントを取り込むための特定の方法がある場合や、ログやメトリクスデータとして取り込む必要がある場合があります。 注記 イベントを取り込む簡単な方法の 1 つは、イベントをログファイルに書き込み、他のログイベントと同じ方法で取り込むことです。 システムでこれらをどのように可視化できるか検討してください。アプリケーションに関連するイベントを特定できますか？データを 1 つのチャートに統合できますか？特定の方法がない場合でも、少なくとも他のデータと並べて時系列チャートを作成し、視覚的に相関関係を確認できるはずです。時間軸を同じにし、比較しやすいように垂直方向に積み重ねることを検討してください。 このページを編集 前へ アラーム イベントとは何を意味するのでしょうか？ イベントが有用な理由 イベントの可視化 イベントに対するアクション

メトリクスは、作成された時間順に保持される一連の数値データです。環境内のサーバー数、ディスク使用量、1 秒あたりのリクエスト数、リクエストの完了までのレイテンシーなど、あらゆるものを追跡するために使用されます。 しかし、メトリクスはインフラストラクチャやアプリケーションの監視に限定されるものではありません。むしろ、あらゆる種類のビジネスやワークロードで、売上、コールキュー、顧客満足度などを追跡するために使用できます。実際、メトリクスは運用データとビジネスメトリクスの両方を組み合わせることで最も有用となり、システムの包括的な可視化を実現します。 メトリクスに関する追加のコンテキストを提供している OpenTelemetry のドキュメントページ を参照することをお勧めします。 KPI (重要業績評価指標) を把握し、測定しましょう！​ メトリクスにおいて 最も 重要なことは、適切なものを測定する ことです。それは誰にとっても異なります。E コマースアプリケーションでは 1 時間あたりの売上が重要な KPI となる可能性がありますが、パン屋では 1 日あたりのクロワッサンの生産数に関心があるかもしれません。 警告 ビジネス KPI の完全で包括的な単一のソースは存在しません。プロジェクトやアプリケーションを十分に理解し、目標とする成果 を把握する必要があります。 最初のステップは、高レベルの目標を定義することです。そしてほとんどの場合、これらの目標はインフラストラクチャだけから得られる単一のメトリクスとしては表現されません。上記の E コマースの例では、1 時間あたりの売上 を測定するという メタ 目標を特定したら、商品購入前の検索時間、チェックアウトプロセスの完了時間、商品検索結果のレイテンシーなどの詳細なメトリクスに遡ることができます。これにより、システムを観察するために関連情報を意図的に収集することができます。 備考 KPI を特定したら、ワークロードのどのメトリクスがそれらに影響を与えるかを Working Backwards で確認できます。 運用メトリクスデータとの相関関係​ Web サーバーの CPU 使用率が高くなると応答時間が遅くなり、その結果、顧客の不満が高まり、最終的に収益が低下する場合、CPU 使用率の測定はビジネスの成果に直接影響を与えるため、絶対に 測定する必要があります！ 逆に、エフェメラルなクラウドリソース（Amazon EC2 フリートや、他のクラウドプロバイダー環境の同様のリソース）でバッチ処理を実行するアプリケーションがある場合、バッチを最も費用対効果の高い方法で完了するために、CPU を可能な限り使用することを 望む かもしれません。 いずれの場合も、運用データ（CPU 使用率など）とビジネスメトリクスを同じシステムに保存し、両者の相関関係を分析する必要があります。 備考 ビジネスメトリクスと運用メトリクスを同じシステムに保存し、両者への影響を観察して結論を導き出せるようにしましょう。 正常な状態を把握しましょう！​ 正常なベースラインを理解することは難しい場合があります。多くの人は、正常なメトリクスがどのようなものかを理解するために、ワークロードにストレステストを実施する必要があります。しかし、ニーズに応じて、既存の運用メトリクスを観察することで、正常なしきい値について安全な結論を導き出すことができる場合もあります。 正常なワークロードとは、KPI の目標を達成しながら、回復力、可用性、コスト効率のバランスが取れているものです。 備考 パフォーマンスが要求される水準を下回るか上回った場合にアラームを作成できるよう、KPI には必ず正常な範囲を特定しておく必要があります。 異常検知アルゴリズムを使用する​ 正常な状態を把握すること の課題は、システム内の すべての メトリクスについて正常な閾値を把握することが現実的ではない場合があることです。 リレーショナルデータベース管理システム (RDBMS) は数十のパフォーマンスメトリクスを出力することができ、マイクロサービスアーキテクチャと組み合わせると、KPI に影響を与える可能性のあるメトリクスが数百に及ぶ可能性があります。 このような大量のデータポイントを監視し、個々の上限と下限の閾値を特定することは、人間が行うには必ずしも現実的ではありません。 しかし、機械学習はこのような反復的なタスクが 非常に 得意です。 自動化と機械学習は、気付かなかった問題を特定するのに役立つため、可能な限り活用してください！ 備考 機械学習アルゴリズムと異常検知モデルを使用して、ワークロードのパフォーマンスの閾値を自動的に計算します。 このページを編集 前へ ログ 次へ トレース KPI (重要業績評価指標) を把握し、測定しましょう！

トレースは、リクエストがアプリケーションの異なるコンポーネントを通過する際の全体的な流れを表現します。 ログやメトリクスとは異なり、トレース は複数のアプリケーションやサービスからのイベントで構成され、レスポンスのレイテンシー、サービスの障害、リクエストパラメータ、メタデータなど、サービス間の接続に関する情報も含まれます。 ヒント ログ とトレースには概念的な類似性がありますが、トレースはクロスサービスのコンテキストで考慮されることを意図しているのに対し、ログは通常、単一のサービスやアプリケーションの実行に限定されます。 今日の開発者は、モジュール化された分散アプリケーションの構築を志向しています。 Service Oriented Architecture と呼ぶ人もいれば、マイクロサービス と呼ぶ人もいます。 名称に関係なく、これらの疎結合なアプリケーションで問題が発生した場合、ログやイベントを見るだけでは、インシデントの根本原因を追跡するのに十分ではない場合があります。 リクエストフローの完全な可視性を持つことが不可欠であり、これがトレースが価値を提供する部分です。 トレースは、エンドツーエンドのリクエストフローを描写する因果関係のある一連のイベントを通じて、その可視性を提供します。

か所にある場合、ソースコードを見てリクエストが異なる機能間でどのように受け渡されるかを確認するのは簡単です。 システムレベルでは、アプリケーションが実行されているマシンを把握でき、問題が発生した場合は迅速に根本原因を特定できます。 異なるコンポーネントが疎結合で分散環境で実行されているマイクロサービスベースのアーキテクチャでこれを行うことを想像してみてください。 相互接続されたリクエストからそれぞれのログを確認するために、多数のシステムにログインすることは、不可能でなくとも非現実的でしょう。 これはオブザーバビリティが役立つところです。 計装はオブザーバビリティを向上させるための重要なステップです。 広義では、計装とはコードを使用してアプリケーション内のイベントを測定することです。 一般的な計装アプローチは、システムに入る各リクエストに一意のトレース識別子を割り当て、追加のメタデータを付加しながら、そのトレース ID を異なるコンポーネント間で伝播させることです。 備考 あるサービスから別のサービスへのすべての接続は、トレースを中央コレクターに送信するように計装する必要があります。このアプローチにより、ワークロードの不透明な側面を可視化できます。 備考 自動計装エージェントやライブラリを使用することで、アプリケーションの計装は大部分を自動化できます。 トランザクション時間とステータスの測定が重要です！​ 適切に計装されたアプリケーションは、エンドツーエンドのトレースを生成できます。これは以下のようなウォーターフォールグラフとして表示できます： またはサービスマップとして表示できます： すべての相互作用におけるトランザクション時間とレスポンスコードを測定することが重要です。 これにより、全体的な処理時間を計算し、SLA、SLO、またはビジネス KPI との適合性を追跡することができます。 備考 相互作用のレスポンス時間とステータスコードを理解し記録することでのみ、全体的なリクエストパターンとワークロードの健全性に影響を与える要因を把握することができます。 メタデータ、アノテーション、ラベルは最高の味方です​ トレースは永続化され、一意の ID が割り当てられ、各トレースは スパン または セグメント (使用するツールによって異なります) に分割され、リクエストパス内の各ステップが記録されます。 スパンは、トレースが相互作用するエンティティを示し、親トレースと同様に、各スパンには一意の ID とタイムスタンプが割り当てられ、追加のデータやメタデータも含めることができます。 この情報は、問題が発生した正確な時間と場所を示すため、デバッグに役立ちます。 これは実践的な例で説明するのが最適です。 E コマースアプリケーションは、認証、認可、配送、在庫、決済処理、注文処理、商品検索、レコメンデーションなど、多くのドメインに分かれている場合があります。 これらの相互接続されたドメインからのトレースをすべて検索するのではなく、トレースに顧客 ID でラベル付けすることで、その特定の人に関連する相互作用のみを検索できます。 これにより、運用上の問題を診断する際に、即座に検索範囲を絞り込むことができます。 備考 ベンダー間で命名規則は異なる場合がありますが、各トレースにメタデータ、ラベル、またはアノテーションを追加でき、これらはワークロード全体で検索可能です。 追加にはコードの記述が必要ですが、ワークロードのオブザーバビリティを大幅に向上させます。 警告 トレースはログではないため、トレースに含めるメタデータは必要最小限にしてください。 また、高いサンプリングレートであっても、トレースデータはフォレンジックや監査を目的としたものではありません。 このページを編集 前へ メトリクス 次へ アラーム すべての統合ポイントを計装する トランザクション時間とステータスの測定が重要です！

で設定したルールに基づいて通知を受け取ることができます。 CloudWatch メトリクスのアラーム： CloudWatch アラームでは、CloudWatch メトリクスの閾値を定義し、メトリクスが範囲外になった場合に通知を受け取ることができます。 各メトリクスは複数のアラームをトリガーでき、各アラームには多くのアクションを関連付けることができます。 CloudWatch メトリクスに基づくメトリクスアラームの設定には、2 つの異なる方法があります。 静的閾値：静的閾値は、メトリクスが違反してはならない固定の制限を表します。 通常の運用時の動作を理解するために、上限と下限のような静的閾値の範囲を定義する必要があります。 メトリクス値が静的閾値を下回るか上回った場合、CloudWatch でアラームを生成するように設定できます。 異常検知：異常検知は、一般的にデータの大部分から大きく逸脱し、正常な動作の明確な概念に適合しない、まれなアイテム、イベント、または観測値として識別されます。 CloudWatch 異常検知は、過去のメトリクスデータを分析し、期待値のモデルを作成します。 期待値は、メトリクスの典型的な時間別、日別、週別のパターンを考慮します。 必要に応じて各メトリクスに異常検知を適用でき、CloudWatch は機械学習アルゴリズムを適用して有効化された各メトリクスの上限と下限を定義し、メトリクスが期待値から外れた場合にのみアラームを生成します。 ヒント 静的閾値は、ワークロードの特定のパフォーマンスブレークポイントやインフラストラクチャコンポーネントの絶対的な制限など、十分に理解しているメトリクスに最適です。 備考 特定のメトリクスの時間経過に伴うパフォーマンスが把握できない場合や、負荷テストまたは異常なトラフィックでメトリクス値が観測されていない場合は、アラームに異常検知モデルを使用してください。 以下の手順に従って、CloudWatch で静的および異常検知ベースのアラームを設定できます。 静的閾値アラーム CloudWatch 異常検知ベースのアラーム 備考 アラーム疲れを軽減したり、生成されるアラームの数によるノイズを減らしたりするために、2 つの高度なアラーム設定方法があります： 複合アラーム：複合アラームには、他のアラームの状態を考慮するルール式が含まれます。 複合アラームは、ルールのすべての条件が満たされた場合にのみ ALARM 状態になります。 複合アラームのルール式で指定できるアラームには、メトリクスアラームと他の複合アラームが含まれます。 複合アラームは、集約によるアラーム疲れの軽減に役立ちます。 Metric Math ベースのアラーム：Metric Math 式を使用して、より意味のある KPI を構築し、それらにアラームを設定できます。 複数のメトリクスを組み合わせて、組み合わせた使用率メトリクスを作成し、それらにアラームを設定できます。 以下の手順では、複合アラームと Metric Math

認証情報2を設定します。EC2 でも、CloudWatch API への認証なしのアクセス3はできません。 要件を満たすルートを使用して、CloudWatch、CloudWatch Logs、その他の AWS エンドポイント4への接続を確保します。これは、インターネット経由、AWS Direct Connect の使用、または プライベートエンドポイント（通常 VPC エンドポイント と呼ばれる）を通じて行うことができます。 備考 環境と CloudWatch 間のトランスポートは、ガバナンスとセキュリティの要件に合致する必要があります。一般的に、AWS 外のワークロードにプライベートエンドポイントを使用することで、最も厳格に規制された業界のお客様のニーズにも対応できます。ただし、ほとんどのお客様にとって、パブリックエンドポイントで十分なサービスを提供できます。 プライベートエンドポイントの使用​ メトリクスとログをプッシュするために、CloudWatch エージェントは CloudWatch および CloudWatch Logs エンドポイントへの接続が必要です。エージェントのインストール場所に応じて、これを実現するための方法がいくつかあります。 VPC からの接続​ a. EC2 で実行されているエージェントの場合、VPC と CloudWatch の間に完全にプライベートで安全な接続を確立するために、VPC エンドポイント (CloudWatch および CloudWatch Logs 用) を使用できます。このアプローチでは、エージェントのトラフィックがインターネットを経由することはありません。 b. もう 1 つの選択肢は、パブリック NAT ゲートウェイ を使用することです。これにより、プライベートサブネットからインターネットに接続できますが、インターネットから予期しない着信接続を受け付けることはありません。 注記 このアプローチでは、エージェントのトラフィックは論理的にインターネット経由でルーティングされることに注意してください。 c. 既存の TLS および Sigv4 メカニズム以外のプライベートまたは安全な接続を確立する必要がない場合、最も簡単な選択肢は インターネットゲートウェイ を使用してエンドポイントへの接続を提供することです。 オンプレミスまたは他のクラウド環境から​ a. AWS 外で実行されているエージェントは、インターネット経由（独自のネットワーク設定を介して）または Direct Connect Public VIF を通じて CloudWatch のパブリックエンドポイントに接続できます。 b. エージェントのトラフィックをインターネットを経由させたくない場合は、AWS PrivateLink を利用した VPC インターフェースエンドポイント を使用して、Direct Connect Private VIF または VPN を使用してオンプレミスネットワークまでのプライベート接続を拡張できます。トラフィックはインターネットに露出されないため、脅威のベクトルを排除できます。 success CloudWatch エージェントで使用する 一時的な AWS アクセストークン を、AWS Systems Manager エージェント

コンソールで プレビュー として利用可能です。一般提供時の機能の範囲は、現在体験できる内容から変更される可能性があります。 ワークロードのすべての層からテレメトリを収集する ことはベストプラクティスですが、これは課題となる場合があります。しかし、ワークロードの層とは何でしょうか？一部の場合は、Web、アプリケーション、データベースサーバーかもしれません。また、フロントエンドとバックエンドとしてワークロードを捉える人もいます。そして、Web アプリケーションを運用する人々は、Real User Monitoring(RUM) を使用して、エンドユーザーが体験するアプリケーションの健全性を観察できます。 しかし、クライアントとデータセンターやクラウドサービスプロバイダー間のトラフィックについてはどうでしょうか？また、Web ページとして提供されず、RUM を使用できないアプリケーションについてはどうでしょうか？ Internet Monitor はネットワークレベルで動作し、観測されたトラフィックの健全性を評価し、AWS の既存の知識 と既知のインターネットの問題を相関分析します。簡単に言えば、インターネットサービスプロバイダー (ISP) にパフォーマンスや可用性の問題があり、かつ アプリケーションのクライアント/サーバー通信がその ISP を使用している場合、Internet Monitor はこのワークロードへの影響について事前に通知することができます。さらに、選択したホスティングリージョンと Content Delivery Network としての CloudFront の使用状況に基づいて推奨事項を提供することができます1。 ヒント Internet Monitor は、ワークロードが通過するネットワークのトラフィックのみを評価します。例えば、他の国の ISP に影響が出ている場合でも、ユーザーがそのキャリアを使用していなければ、その問題を可視化することはできません。 インターネットを経由するアプリケーションのモニターを作成する​ Internet Monitor は、影響を受けている ISP から CloudFront ディストリビューションまたは VPC に到達するトラフィックを監視することで動作します。これにより、ネットワークの問題によって発生するビジネス上の問題を軽減するために、アプリケーションの動作、ルーティング、またはユーザー通知に関する判断を行うことができます。 備考 インターネットを経由するトラフィックを監視するモニターのみを作成してください。プライベートネットワーク (RFC1918) 内のホスト間などのプライベートトラフィックは、Internet Monitor で監視することはできません。 備考 該当する場合は、モバイルアプリケーションからのトラフィックを優先してください。プロバイダー間をローミングしているお客様や、遠隔地にいるお客様は、異なる予期しない体験をする可能性があり、それを把握しておく必要があります。 EventBridge と CloudWatch を通じたアクションの有効化​ 観測された問題は、ソースが aws.internetmonitor として識別される スキーマ を使用して EventBridge を通じて公開されます。EventBridge を使用して、チケット管理システムに自動的に問題を作成したり、サポートチームにページングを送信したり、一部のシナリオを緩和するためにワークロードを変更する自動化をトリガーしたりすることができます。 { \"source\": [\"aws.internetmonitor\"] } 同様に、観測された都市、国、メトロ、地域のトラフィックの詳細な情報は CloudWatch Logs で確認できます。これにより、影響を受けるお客様に対して、その地域特有の問題について事前に通知できる、非常にターゲットを絞ったアクションを作成できます。以下は、単一のプロバイダーに関する国レベルの観測の例です： { \"version\": 1, \"timestamp\": 1669659900, \"clientLocation\": { \"latitude\": 0,

データの履歴を確認し、関連する他のデータと並べて表示することができます。 また、コンテキストを提供することもできます。 全体像を理解するのに役立ちます。 多くの場合、データを収集してアラームを作成した後、そこで終わってしまいます。 しかし、アラームは特定の時点のデータ、通常は単一のメトリクスまたは少量のデータセットしか表示しません。 ダッシュボードは、時間の経過に伴う動作を確認するのに役立ちます。 実践的な例：高 CPU に対するアラームを考える​ マシンが望ましい値よりも高い CPU で動作していることがわかりました。対応が必要でしょうか？また、どのくらい早く対応する必要があるでしょうか？判断の助けとなる要素を見てみましょう。 このインスタンス/アプリケーションの通常の CPU 使用率はどのくらいですか？ これは一時的なスパイクですか？それとも CPU が増加傾向にありますか？ パフォーマンスに影響が出ていますか？影響が出ていない場合、影響が出るまでどのくらいの時間がありますか？ これは定期的に発生する事象ですか？また、通常は自然に回復しますか？ データの履歴を確認する​ CPU の履歴を示す時系列グラフがあるダッシュボードを考えてみましょう。 このメトリクスだけでも、一時的なスパイクなのか、上昇傾向なのかを確認できます。 また、上昇傾向の速さも確認でき、対応の優先順位を判断することができます。 ワークフローへの影響を確認する​ しかし、このマシンは何をしているのでしょうか？全体的な文脈の中でどの程度重要なのでしょうか？ここで、レスポンスタイム、スループット、エラー、その他の指標など、ワークフローのパフォーマンスの可視化を追加することを考えてみましょう。 これにより、高い CPU 使用率がこのインスタンスがサポートしているワークフローやユーザーにどのような影響を与えているかを確認できます。 アラームの履歴を確認する​ アラームが過去 1 ヶ月間にどのくらいの頻度で発生したかを示す可視化を追加し、さらに過去に遡って定期的に発生しているかどうかを確認することを検討してください。 たとえば、バックアップジョブがスパイクを引き起こしているのでしょうか？ 再発のパターンを知ることで、根本的な問題を理解し、アラームの再発を完全に防ぐための長期的な判断を行うことができます。 コンテキストを追加する​ 最後に、ダッシュボードにコンテキストを追加します。このダッシュボードが存在する理由、関連するワークフロー、問題が発生した場合の対処方法、ドキュメントへのリンク、連絡先などの簡単な説明を含めます。 備考 これで、ダッシュボードのユーザーが何が起きているのかを把握し、影響を理解し、適切なアクションとその緊急性についてデータに基づいた判断を下すのに役立つ ストーリー が完成しました。 すべてを一度に可視化しようとしない​ アラーム疲れについてよく話題に上がります。 優先順位や対応方法が不明確な多数のアラームは、チームに過負荷をかけ、非効率を招く可能性があります。 アラームは、重要で対応可能な事項に対してのみ設定すべきです。 ダッシュボードはこの点でより柔軟です。 アラームのように即座の注意を要求しないため、まだ重要性が確実でない事項や、探索をサポートする情報を可視化する自由度が高くなります。 ただし、やりすぎは禁物です！良いものでも、やりすぎは逆効果になります。 ダッシュボードは、あなたにとって重要な事項の全体像を提供すべきです。 データの取り込みを決定する場合と同様に、ダッシュボードで何が重要かを考える必要があります。 ダッシュボードについて、以下の点を考慮してください： 誰が閲覧するのか？ 閲覧者のバックグラウンドと知識は？ どの程度のコンテキストが必要か？ どのような質問に答えようとしているのか？ このデータを見て、どのようなアクションを取ることになるのか？ ヒント ダッシュボードのストーリーや含めるべき内容を決めるのが難しい場合があります。 ダッシュボードの設計をどこから始めればよいでしょうか？ KPI 駆動型 または インシデント駆動型 の 2 つのアプローチを見てみましょう。 ダッシュボードの設計：KPI 主導型​ これを理解する 1 つの方法は、KPI から逆算することです。これは通常、非常にユーザー主導型のアプローチです。 レイアウト については、通常、上から下へと作業を進め、ダッシュボードを下に移動するか、より下位レベルのダッシュボードに移動するにつれて、より詳細な情報を得ることができます。 まず、KPI を理解する 必要があります。その意味を理解することで、どのように可視化したいかを決定するのに役立ちます。 多くの KPI は単一の数値として表示されます。例えば、特定のワークフローを正常に完了する顧客の割合は何パーセントで、どのくらいの時間がかかっているでしょうか？しかし、どの期間で測定するのでしょうか？1 週間の平均では KPI を満たしていても、その中の短い期間で基準を超えてしまうことがあるかもしれません。これらの違反は重要ですか？顧客体験に影響を与えますか？もしそうなら、異なる期間と時系列グラフで KPI を確認することを検討するかもしれません。また、すべての人が詳細を見る必要はないかもしれないので、KPI の内訳を別のダッシュボードに移動して、別のオーディエンス向けにすることも考えられます。 次に、それらの KPI に何が寄与しているか を考えます。それらのアクションを実行するために、どのようなワークフローが実行される必要がありますか？これらを測定できますか？ 主要なコンポーネントを特定し、それらのパフォーマンスの可視化を追加します。KPI が違反した場合、ワークフロー内のどこに主な影響があるのかを素早く確認できるようにする必要があります。 さらに掘り下げることもできます - それらのワークフローのパフォーマンスに何が影響を与えているのでしょうか？深さのレベルを決定する際は、オーディエンスを意識してください。 注文数を KPI とする e コマースシステムの例を考えてみましょう。 注文を行うためには、ユーザーは以下のアクションを実行できる必要があります：商品の検索、カートへの追加、配送先の詳細の追加、注文の支払いです。 これらの各ワークフローについて、主要なコンポーネントが機能しているかどうかを確認することを検討するかもしれません。例えば、RUM や Synthetics を使用してアクションの成功に関するデータを取得し、ユーザーが問題の影響を受けているかどうかを確認します。スループット、レイテンシー、アクション失敗率の測定を検討して、各アクションのパフォーマンスが期待通りかどうかを確認するかもしれません。基盤となるインフラストラクチャの測定を検討して、パフォーマンスに何が影響を与えているかを確認するかもしれません。 ただし、すべての情報を同じダッシュボードに配置しないでください。ここでも、ユーザーのオーディエンスを考慮してください。 備考 ドリルダウンを可能にし、適切なユーザーに適切なコンテキストを提供するダッシュボードの層を作成します。 ダッシュボードの設計：インシデント駆動型​ 多くの人にとって、インシデント解決はオブザーバビリティの重要な目的です。 ユーザーやオブザーバビリティのアラームによってインシデントが通知された場合、迅速に修正を見つけ、問題の根本原因を特定する必要があります。 備考 最近のインシデントを振り返ってみましょう。共通のパターンはありますか？会社にとってどのインシデントが最も影響が大きかったですか？どのインシデントが繰り返し発生していますか？ ここでは、インシデントの深刻度を理解し、根本原因を特定して修正しようとする人のためのダッシュボードを設計します。 具体的なインシデントを振り返ってみましょう。 報告されたインシデントをどのように確認しましたか？ 何を確認しましたか？エンドポイント？エラー？ インシデントの影響とそれに基づく優先度をどのように理解しましたか？ 問題の原因を調査する際に何を確認しましたか？ Application Performance Monitoring (APM) は、エンドポイントとワークフローの定期的なベースラインとテストのための Synthetics と、実際の顧客体験のための RUM で役立ちます。 このデータを使用して、影響を受けているワークフローとその程度を素早く可視化できます。 時系列でのエラー数や上位のエラーを表示する可視化は、適切な領域に焦点を当て、エラーの具体的な詳細を示すのに役立ちます。 ここでは、ログデータとエラーコードや理由の動的な可視化を使用することが多いです。 できるだけ早く詳細にアクセスできるように、フィルタリングやドリルダウンの機能を持たせることが非常に有用です。 オーバーヘッドを抑えながらこれを実装する方法を考えてください。 例えば、フィルタリングで詳細にアクセスできる単一のダッシュボードを用意する方法があります。 レイアウト​ ダッシュボードのレイアウトも重要です。 備考 通常、ユーザーにとって最も重要な可視化は、左上または自然なページナビゲーションの 開始点 に合わせて配置します。 レイアウトを使用してストーリーを伝えることができます。たとえば、上から下へのレイアウトを使用して、下にスクロールするほど詳細な情報が表示されるようにすることができます。または、左側に上位レベルのサービスを配置し、右に移動するにつれてその依存関係を表示する左右のレイアウトも有用かもしれません。 動的なコンテンツの作成​ 多くのワークロードは、需要に応じて拡大または縮小するように設計されており、ダッシュボードはこれを考慮する必要があります。 たとえば、インスタンスを Auto Scaling グループに配置し、特定の負荷に達すると追加のインスタンスが追加される場合があります。 備考 特定の ID で指定されたインスタンスからのデータを表示するダッシュボードでは、新しいインスタンスからのデータを表示することができません。 リソースとデータにメタデータを追加することで、特定のメタデータ値を持つすべてのインスタンスを取得する可視化を作成できます。 これにより、実際の状態を反映することができます。 動的な可視化の別の例として、現在発生している上位 10 個のエラーと、それらが最近どのように推移しているかを確認できることが挙げられます。 どのようなエラーが発生するかを事前に知ることなく、テーブルやチャートを表示できるようにする必要があります。 原因よりも症状を最初に考える​ 症状を観察するということは、ユーザーやシステムへの影響を考慮することです。 同じ症状でも、その根本的な原因は複数存在する可能性があります。 これにより、未知の問題を含む、より多くの問題を捉えることができます。 原因を理解するにつれて、下位レベルのダッシュボードはより具体的になり、問題の診断と修正を迅速に行うのに役立ちます。 ヒント 先週ユーザーに影響を与えた特定の JavaScript エラーを捉えるのではなく、中断されたワークフローへの 影響 を捉え、最近の履歴における JavaScript エラーの発生数の上位、または最近急激に増加したエラーを表示します。 上位/下位 N を使用する​ 通常、運用メトリクスを すべて 同時に可視化する必要はありません。 EC2 インスタンスの大規模なフリートはその良い例です。数百台のサーバーすべてのディスク IOPS や CPU 使用率を同時に表示する必要性や価値はありません。 これは、最も良い（または悪い）パフォーマンスのリソースを確認するよりも、メトリクスを掘り下げることに多くの時間を費やすというアンチパターンを生み出します。 備考 ダッシュボードでは、各メトリクスの上位 10 個または 20 個を表示し、それが明らかにする症状に焦点を当ててください。 CloudWatch metrics では、任意の時系列データの上位 N を検索できます。 例えば、以下のクエリは CPU 使用率が最も高い上位 20 個の EC2 インスタンスを返します： SORT(SEARCH('{AWS/EC2,InstanceId} MetricName=\"CPUUtilization\"', 'Average', 300), SUM, DESC, 10) このアプローチ、または CloudWatch Metric Insights を使用して、ダッシュボードで最高または最低のパフォーマンスを示すメトリクスを特定してください。 しきい値を使用して KPI を視覚的に表示する​ KPI には警告またはエラーのしきい値を設定する必要があり、ダッシュボードでは水平アノテーションを使用してこれを表示できます。 これはウィジェット上に高水位線として表示されます。 これを視覚的に表示することで、ビジネスの成果やインフラストラクチャが危険な状態にある場合に、オペレーターに事前に警告を与えることができます。 備考 水平アノテーションは、十分に開発されたダッシュボードの重要な要素です。 コンテキストの重要性​ 人はデータを誤って解釈しやすいものです。 個人の背景や現在のコンテキストによって、データの見方が変わってきます。 そのため、ダッシュボードには必ず テキスト を含めるようにしてください。 このデータは何のためのものか、誰のためのものか、何を意味しているのか、アプリケーションのドキュメント、サポート担当者、トラブルシューティングドキュメントへのリンクを含めてください。 テキスト表示を使用してダッシュボードの表示を分割することもできます。 左側に配置して左右のコンテキストを設定したり、水平方向に全幅で配置してダッシュボードを垂直に分割したりすることができます。 備考 IT サポート、オンコール運用担当者、ビジネスオーナーへのリンクを用意することで、問題が発生した際に支援を受けられる担当者に素早く連絡することができます。 ヒント チケットシステムへのハイパーリンクもダッシュボードに追加すると非常に便利です。 このページを編集 前へ

オブザーバビリティのために AWS を使用する場合（オンプレミスまたは他のクラウド環境でホストしているかに関わらず）、CloudWatch エージェント や Fluentd などのツールを活用して、分析用のログデータを送信できます。 ここでは、ロギング用の CloudWatch エージェントの実装と、AWS コンソールまたは API 内での CloudWatch Logs の使用に関するベストプラクティスについて詳しく説明します。 備考 CloudWatch エージェントは、メトリクスデータ を CloudWatch に送信するためにも使用できます。実装の詳細については、メトリクス ページを参照してください。また、OpenTelemetry や X-Ray クライアント SDK からのトレース を収集し、AWS X-Ray に送信するためにも使用できます。 CloudWatch エージェントを使用したログの収集​ 転送​ クラウドファーストアプローチ によるオブザーバビリティでは、原則として、ログを取得するためにマシンにログインする必要がある場合、それはアンチパターンとなります。 ワークロードは、ログ分析システムにほぼリアルタイムでログデータを送信する必要があり、送信とイベント発生の間の遅延は、ワークロードに災害が発生した場合に、その時点の情報が失われる可能性を意味します。 アーキテクトとして、許容可能なログデータの損失を判断し、それに応じて CloudWatch エージェントの force_flush_interval を調整する必要があります。 force_flush_interval は、バッファサイズに達しない限り、エージェントに定期的にログデータをデータプレーンに送信するよう指示します。 バッファサイズに達した場合は、バッファされたすべてのログを直ちに送信します。 ヒント エッジデバイスは、AWS 内の低レイテンシーワークロードとは大きく異なる要件を持つ場合があり、より長い force_flush_interval 設定が必要になる場合があります。 例えば、低帯域幅のインターネット接続を使用する IoT デバイスでは、15 分ごとにログをフラッシュするだけで十分な場合があります。 備考 コンテナ化されたワークロードやステートレスワークロードは、ログのフラッシュ要件に特に敏感な場合があります。 いつでもスケールインできるステートレスな Kubernetes アプリケーションや EC2 フリートを考えてみてください。 これらのリソースが突然終了した場合、将来ログを抽出する方法がなくなり、ログが失われる可能性があります。 標準の force_flush_interval は通常これらのシナリオに適していますが、必要に応じて短縮することができます。 ロググループ​ CloudWatch Logs では、アプリケーションに論理的に適用されるログのコレクションは、1 つの ロググループ に配信される必要があります。そのロググループ内では、ログストリームを作成するソースシステム間に 共通性 が必要です。 LAMP スタックを例に考えてみましょう。Apache、MySQL、PHP アプリケーション、ホスティング Linux オペレーティングシステムからのログは、それぞれ別のロググループに属します。 このグループ化は重要です。保持期間、暗号化キー、メトリクスフィルター、サブスクリプションフィルター、Contributor Insights ルールを同じように扱うことができるためです。 備考 ロググループ内のログストリーム数に制限はなく、CloudWatch Logs Insights クエリを使用して、アプリケーションのすべてのログを一度に検索できます。Kubernetes サービスの各 Pod や、フリート内の各 EC2 インスタンスに対して個別のログストリームを持つことは、標準的なパターンです。 備考 ロググループのデフォルトの保持期間は 無期限 です。ベストプラクティスは、ロググループ作成時に保持期間を設定することです。 CloudWatch コンソールでいつでも設定できますが、ベストプラクティスとしては、Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation、Cloud Development Kit など) を使用してロググループ作成と同時に設定するか、CloudWatch エージェント設定内の retention_in_days 設定を使用することをお勧めします。 いずれのアプローチでも、プロジェクトのデータ保持要件に合わせて、ログ保持期間を事前に設定できます。 備考 ロググループのデータは CloudWatch Logs で常に暗号化されます。デフォルトでは、CloudWatch Logs は保管時のログデータに対して サーバーサイド 暗号化を使用します。代替として、この暗号化に AWS Key Management Service を使用することもできます。AWS KMS を使用した暗号化 は、ロググループの作成時または作成後に KMS キーをロググループに関連付けることで、ロググループレベルで有効化されます。これは Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation、Cloud Development Kit など) を使用して設定できます。 CloudWatch Logs のキー管理に AWS Key Management Service を使用するには、追加の設定とユーザーへのキーに対する権限付与が必要です。1 ログのフォーマット​ CloudWatch Logs は、取り込み時に自動的にログフィールドを検出し、JSON データをインデックス化する機能を持っています。 この機能により、アドホッククエリとフィルタリングが容易になり、ログデータの使いやすさが向上します。 ただし、自動インデックス化は構造化データにのみ適用されることに注意してください。 非構造化ログデータは自動的にインデックス化されませんが、CloudWatch Logs に配信することは可能です。 非構造化ログは、parse コマンドを使用して正規表現で検索やクエリを実行することができます。 備考 CloudWatch Logs を使用する際のログフォーマットに関する 2 つのベストプラクティス： Log4j、python-json-logger、またはフレームワーク固有の JSON エミッターなどの構造化ログフォーマッターを使用する。 ログの出力先に 1 イベントにつき 1 行のログを送信する。 複数行の JSON ログを送信する場合、各行が 1 つのイベントとして解釈されることに注意してください。 stdout の取り扱い​ ログシグナル のページで説明したように、ベストプラクティスはロギングシステムをアプリケーションから切り離すことです。しかし、stdout からファイルにデータを送信することは、多くのプラットフォームで一般的なパターンです。 Kubernetes や Amazon Elastic Container Service などのコンテナオーケストレーションシステムは、stdout からログファイルへの配信を自動的に管理し、コレクターから各ログを収集できるようにします。CloudWatch エージェントはこのファイルをリアルタイムで読み取り、データをロググループに転送します。 備考 可能な限り、エージェントによる収集と組み合わせて、stdout へのシンプルなアプリケーションロギングのパターンを使用してください。 ログのフィルタリング​ 個人データの永続的な保存を防ぐ場合や、特定のログレベルのデータのみを取得する場合など、ログをフィルタリングする理由は多くあります。 いずれの場合も、発生源システムにできるだけ近い場所でフィルタリングを実行することがベストプラクティスです。 CloudWatch の場合、これは分析のために CloudWatch Logs にデータが配信される 前 を意味します。 CloudWatch エージェントはこのフィルタリングを実行できます。 備考 filters 機能を使用して、必要なログレベルを include し、クレジットカード番号や電話番号など、望ましくないパターンを exclude します。 ヒント ログに漏洩する可能性のある既知のデータの特定の形式をフィルタリングすることは、時間がかかり、エラーが発生しやすい場合があります。 ただし、特定の種類の望ましくないデータ（クレジットカード番号、社会保障番号など）を扱うワークロードの場合、これらのレコードのフィルターを設定することで、将来の潜在的なコンプライアンス問題を防ぐことができます。 たとえば、社会保障番号を含むすべてのレコードを削除するには、次のような簡単な設定で実現できます： \"filters\": [ { \"type\": \"exclude\", \"expression\": \"\\b(?!000|666|9\\d{2})([0-8]\\d{2}|7([0-6]\\d))([-]?|\\s{1})(?!00)\\d\\d\\2(?!0000)\\d{4}\\b\" } ] マルチライン ロギング​ すべてのロギングのベストプラクティスは、個別のログイベントごとに 1 行を出力する 構造化ロギング を使用することです。 しかし、この選択肢がない多くのレガシーシステムや ISV サポートのアプリケーションが存在します。 これらのワークロードでは、マルチライン対応のプロトコルを使用して出力しない限り、CloudWatch Logs は各行を個別のイベントとして解釈します。 CloudWatch エージェントは multi_line_start_pattern ディレクティブを使用してこれを実行できます。 備考 CloudWatch Logs へのマルチラインログの取り込みを容易にするために、multi_line_start_pattern ディレクティブを使用してください。 ログクラスの設定​ CloudWatch Logs では、2 つのクラスのロググループを提供しています： CloudWatch Logs Standard ログクラスは、リアルタイムモニタリングが必要なログや頻繁にアクセスするログのための、フル機能を備えたオプションです。 CloudWatch Logs Infrequent Access ログクラスは、ログを費用対効果の高い方法で統合できる新しいログクラスです。このログクラスは、管理されたインジェスト、ストレージ、クロスアカウントログ分析、暗号化などの CloudWatch Logs の機能のサブセットを、GB あたりの低いインジェスト価格で提供します。Infrequent Access ログクラスは、アドホックなクエリやアクセス頻度の低いログに対する事後のフォレンジック分析に最適です。 備考 新しいロググループに使用するロググループクラスを指定するには、log_group_class ディレクティブを使用します。有効な値は STANDARD と INFREQUENT_ACCESS です。このフィールドを省略した場合、エージェントはデフォルトの STANDARD を使用します。 適切なクラス指定のための既存ログの監査​ CloudWatch Logs の Infrequent Access 階層のログクラスは、CloudWatch ログ機能の一部を利用します。 標準のロググループを Infrequent Access ロググループとして再作成できるかどうかを確認するため、既存のロググループを監査することをお勧めします。 これを行うには、log-ia-checker CLI ツールを実行するのが良い方法です。 このツールは、指定されたリージョン内のすべてのロググループを分析し、Infrequent Access に移行可能なログの出力を提供します。 CloudWatch Logs での検索​ クエリスコープによるコストの管理​ CloudWatch Logs にデータが配信されると、必要に応じてデータを検索できるようになります。CloudWatch Logs はスキャンされたデータ量に応じて料金が発生することに注意してください。クエリスコープを制御し、スキャンされるデータ量を削減するための戦略がいくつかあります。 備考 ログを検索する際は、時間と日付の範囲が適切であることを確認してください。CloudWatch Logs では、スキャンの相対的または絶対的な時間範囲を設定できます。前日のエントリのみを探している場合、今日のログのスキャンを含める必要はありません！ 備考 1 つのクエリで複数のロググループを検索できますが、その場合はスキャンされるデータ量が増加します。対象とするロググループを特定したら、それに合わせてクエリスコープを縮小してください。 ヒント CloudWatch コンソールから、各クエリが実際にスキャンしたデータ量を直接確認できます。この方法を使用することで、効率的なクエリを作成するのに役立ちます。 クエリの共有​ CloudWatch Logs のクエリ構文 は複雑ではありませんが、特定のクエリを一から作成するのは時間がかかる場合があります。 同じ AWS アカウント内のユーザー間で、適切に作成されたクエリを共有することで、アプリケーションログの調査を効率化できます。 これは AWS マネジメントコンソール から直接、または CloudFormation や AWS CDK を使用してプログラムで実現できます。 これにより、ログデータを分析する必要がある他のユーザーの作業量を削減できます。 備考 頻繁に使用されるクエリを CloudWatch Logs に保存することで、ユーザーがすぐに利用できるようになります。 パターン分析​ CloudWatch Logs Insights は、ログをクエリする際に機械学習アルゴリズムを使用してパターンを見つけます。 パターンは、ログフィールド間で繰り返し出現する共通のテキスト構造です。 多数のログイベントを少数のパターンに圧縮できることが多いため、パターンは大規模なログセットの分析に役立ちます。2 備考 パターンを使用して、ログデータを自動的にパターンにクラスタリングします。 前の時間範囲との比較 (diff)​ CloudWatch Logs Insights では、時間の経過に伴うログイベントの変更を比較することができ、エラーの検出とトレンドの特定に役立ちます。 比較クエリはパターンを明らかにし、迅速なトレンド分析を容易にし、より詳細な調査のためにサンプルの生ログイベントを調べることができます。 クエリは、選択された期間と同じ長さの比較期間の 2 つの時間帯に対して分析されます。3 備考 diff

SLG/EDU 向け CloudWatch Logs データ保護ポリシー 一般的にログデータは有用ですが、医療保険の携行性と責任に関する法律 (HIPAA)、一般データ保護規則 (GDPR)、支払いカード業界データセキュリティ基準 (PCI-DSS)、連邦リスク認証管理プログラム (FedRAMP) などの厳格な規制を持つ組織にとって、データのマスキングは有用です。 CloudWatch Logs のデータ保護ポリシーにより、顧客は機密データのトランジットデータをスキャンし、検出された機密データをマスクするデータ保護ポリシーを定義して適用できます。 これらのポリシーは、パターンマッチングと機械学習モデルを活用して機密データを検出し、アカウントの CloudWatch ロググループに取り込まれたイベントに表示されるデータの監査とマスクを支援します。 機密データを選択するために使用される手法と基準は、マッチングデータ識別子と呼ばれます。これらの管理されたデータ識別子を使用して、CloudWatch Logs は以下を検出できます： 秘密鍵や AWS シークレットアクセスキーなどの認証情報 IP アドレスや MAC アドレスなどのデバイス識別子 銀行口座番号、クレジットカード番号、クレジットカード確認コードなどの金融情報 健康保険カード番号 (EHIC) や個人健康番号などの保護された健康情報 (PHI) 運転免許証、社会保障番号、納税者識別番号などの個人を特定できる情報 (PII) 注記 機密データはロググループに取り込まれる際に検出およびマスクされます。データ保護ポリシーを設定しても、それ以前にロググループに取り込まれたログイベントはマスクされません。 上記で言及したデータタイプのいくつかについて詳しく見て、例を確認してみましょう： データ型​ 認証情報​ 認証情報は機密性の高いデータ型で、あなたが誰であるか、またリクエストしているリソースへのアクセス権限があるかを確認するために使用されます。 AWS は、プライベートキーやシークレットアクセスキーなどの認証情報を使用して、リクエストの認証と承認を行います。 CloudWatch Logs データ保護ポリシーを使用すると、選択したデータ識別子に一致する機密データがマスクされます。 （セクションの最後でマスクされた例を確認します）。 ヒント データ分類のベストプラクティスは、組織、法律、およびコンプライアンス基準を満たす、明確に定義されたデータ分類層と要件から始まります。 ベストプラクティスとして、組織のデータガバナンスポリシーに従ってコンプライアンスを実装するために、データ分類フレームワークに基づいて AWS リソースにタグを付けてください。 ヒント ログイベントに機密データが含まれることを避けるために、最初からコードで機密データを除外し、必要な情報のみをログに記録することがベストプラクティスです。 金融情報​ Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) で定義されているように、銀行口座、ルーティング番号、デビットカードおよびクレジットカード番号、クレジットカードの磁気ストライプデータは、機密性の高い金融情報とみなされます。 機密データを検出するために、CloudWatch Logs はデータ保護ポリシーを設定すると、ロググループの地理的な場所に関係なく、指定したデータ識別子をスキャンします。 備考 金融データタイプとデータ識別子の完全なリストを確認してください。 保護対象医療情報 (PHI)​ PHI には、保険および請求情報、診断データ、医療記録やデータセット、画像や検査結果などの臨床ケアデータを含む、非常に幅広い個人を特定できる健康および健康関連データが含まれます。 CloudWatch Logs は、選択されたロググループから医療情報をスキャンして検出し、そのデータをマスクします。 備考 PHI データタイプとデータ識別子の完全なリストを確認してください。 個人を特定できる情報 (PII)​ PII は、個人を特定するために使用できる個人データへのテキスト参照です。PII の例には、住所、銀行口座番号、電話番号などが含まれます。 備考 PII データタイプとデータ識別子の完全なリストを確認してください。 マスクされたログ​ データ保護ポリシーを設定したロググループを確認すると、データ保護が On になっており、コンソールには機密データの数も表示されています。 View in Log Insights をクリックすると、Log Insights

データ保護ポリシーを作成すると、デフォルトで選択したデータ識別子に一致する機密データがマスクされます。マスクされていないデータを表示できるのは、logs:Unmask IAM 権限を持つユーザーのみです。 ヒント CloudWatch の機密データへのアクセスを管理および制限するには、AWS IAM and Access Management(IAM) を使用してください。 ヒント クラウド環境の定期的なモニタリングと監査は、機密データを保護する上で同様に重要です。アプリケーションが大量のデータを生成する場合、これは重要な側面となります。そのため、過剰なデータをログに記録しないことが推奨されます。Logging Best Practices の AWS Prescriptive Guidance をご覧ください。 ヒント ロググループのデータは CloudWatch Logs では常に暗号化されています。また、AWS Key Management Service を使用してログデータを暗号化することもできます。 ヒント レジリエンスとスケーラビリティのために、CloudWatch アラームを設定し、AWS Amazon EventBridge と AWS Systems Manager を使用して修復を自動化してください。 このページを編集 前へ CloudWatch

システムやリソースに関連するすべてのメトリクスを一元化された場所に集約することで、メトリクスの比較、パフォーマンスの分析、リソースのスケールアップやスケールインなどの戦略的な意思決定を行うことができます。 また、メトリクスはリソースの健全性を把握し、予防措置を講じる上でも重要です。 メトリクスデータは基盤となるもので、アラーム、異常検知、イベント、ダッシュボード などの機能を実現するために使用されます。 ベンダーメトリクス​ CloudWatch メトリクス は、システムのパフォーマンスに関するデータを収集します。デフォルトでは、ほとんどの AWS サービスが、そのリソースのメトリクスを無料で提供しています。これには Amazon EC2 インスタンス、Amazon RDS、Amazon S3 バケットなど、多くのサービスが含まれます。 これらのメトリクスを ベンダーメトリクス と呼びます。AWS アカウントでのベンダーメトリクスの収集に料金はかかりません。 備考 CloudWatch にメトリクスを送信する AWS サービスの完全なリストは、このページをご覧ください。 メトリクスのクエリ​ CloudWatch の metric math 機能を使用して、複数のメトリクスに対してクエリを実行し、数式を使用してより詳細なメトリクスの分析ができます。 例えば、以下のような Metric Math の式を使用して Lambda のエラー率を調べることができます： Errors/Requests 以下は、CloudWatch コンソールでの表示例です： 備考 Metric Math を使用してデータから最大限の価値を引き出し、個別のデータソースのパフォーマンスから値を導き出すことができます。 CloudWatch は条件文もサポートしています。 例えば、レイテンシーが特定のしきい値を超えた場合に各時系列に対して 1 を返し、その他のデータポイントに対して 0 を返すクエリは以下のようになります： IF(latency>threshold, 1, 0) CloudWatch コンソールでは、この論理を使用してブール値を作成し、CloudWatch alarms やその他のアクションをトリガーすることができます。 これにより、導出されたデータポイントから自動アクションを実行できます。 以下は CloudWatch コンソールでの例です： 備考 条件文を使用して、導出された値がしきい値を超えた場合にアラームと通知をトリガーすることができます。 また、SEARCH 関数を使用して任意のメトリクスの上位 n 件を表示することもできます。 多数の時系列（例：数千台のサーバー）にわたるメトリクスのパフォーマンスの最高値または最低値を可視化する場合、このアプローチを使用することで最も重要なデータのみを表示できます。 以下は、過去 5 分間で CPU 使用率が最も高い上位 2 つの EC2 インスタンスを返す検索の例です： SLICE(SORT(SEARCH('{AWS/EC2,InstanceId} MetricName=\"CPUUtilization\"', 'Average', 300), MAX, DESC),0, 2) 以下は CloudWatch コンソールでの表示例です： 備考 SEARCH アプローチを使用して、環境内で価値のあるリソースやパフォーマンスの悪いリソースを素早く表示し、それらを dashboards に表示することができます。 メトリクスの収集​ EC2 インスタンスのメモリやディスク容量使用率などの追加メトリクスが必要な場合は、CloudWatch エージェント を使用して、これらのデータを CloudWatch に送信できます。また、グラフィカルな形式で可視化する必要のあるカスタム処理データがあり、そのデータを CloudWatch メトリクスとして表示したい場合は、PutMetricData API を使用してカスタムメトリクスを CloudWatch に公開できます。 備考 API を直接使用するのではなく、AWS SDK のいずれかを使用して、メトリクスデータを CloudWatch に送信してください。 PutMetricData API の呼び出しは、クエリ数に応じて課金されます。PutMetricData API を最適に使用するのがベストプラクティスです。この API の Values and Counts メソッドを使用すると、1 回の PutMetricData リクエストで 1 つのメトリクスに最大 150 個の値を公開でき、このデータのパーセンタイル統計の取得をサポートします。したがって、データポイントごとに個別の API 呼び出しを行うのではなく、すべてのデータポイントをグループ化して、1 回の PutMetricData API 呼び出しで CloudWatch にプッシュする必要があります。このアプローチは、次の 2 つの点でユーザーにメリットがあります： CloudWatch の料金 PutMetricData API のスロットリングを防止できる 備考 PutMetricData を使用する場合、可能な限りデータを単一の PUT 操作にバッチ処理することがベストプラクティスです。 備考 大量のメトリクスが CloudWatch に送信される場合は、代替アプローチとして Embedded Metric Format の使用を検討してください。Embedded Metric Format は PutMetricData を使用せず、その使用に対する課金もありませんが、CloudWatch Logs の使用に対する課金は発生します。 異常検知​ CloudWatch には 異常検知 機能があり、記録されたメトリクスに基づいて 正常 な状態を学習することで、オブザーバビリティ戦略を強化します。 異常検知の使用は、メトリクスシグナル収集システムにおける ベストプラクティス です。 異常検知は 2 週間の期間にわたってモデルを構築します。 警告 異常検知は、作成時点以降のデータからのみモデルを構築します。過去に遡って異常値を検出することはできません。 警告 異常検知は、メトリクスにとって何が 良い かではなく、標準偏差に基づいて何が 正常 かのみを判断します。 備考 ベストプラクティスは、正常な動作が予想される時間帯のみを分析するように異常検知モデルを学習させることです。学習から除外する期間（夜間、週末、休日など）を定義することができます。 以下は異常検知バンドの例で、グレーの帯で示されています。

コンソール、ローカル設定ファイル、またはその両方で設定できます。 ローカル設定は、コンソールで設定されたものよりも優先されます。 備考 可能な限り、X-Ray コンソール、API、または CloudFormation を使用してください。 これにより、実行時にアプリケーションのサンプリング動作を変更できます。 以下の各基準に対して、個別にサンプルレートを設定できます： サービス名（e.g. billing、payments） サービスタイプ（e.g. EC2、Container） HTTP メソッド URL パス リソース ARN ホスト (e.g. www.example.com) ベストプラクティスは、問題の診断とパフォーマンスプロファイルを理解するのに十分なデータを収集しつつ、管理が困難になるほど多くのデータを収集しないようなサンプルレートを設定することです。 例えば、ランディングページのトラフィックの 1% をサンプリングし、決済ページへのリクエストの 10% をサンプリングすることは、効果的なオブザーバビリティの実践に適しています。 一部のトランザクションは 100% キャプチャしたい場合もあるでしょう。 ただし、トレースはワークロードへのアクセスのフォレンシック監査を目的としていないため、注意が必要です！ 警告 トレースは監査やフォレンシック分析での使用を意図していないため、100% のサンプルレートは避けてください。 これにより、X-Ray（デフォルトで UDP エミッターを使用）がトランザクショントレースを決して失わないという誤った期待を生む可能性があります。 原則として、トランザクショントレースの取得が、スタッフや AWS の請求に過度な負担をかけることは避けるべきです。 ワークロードが出力するデータ量を学習しながら、環境にトレースを少しずつ追加していきます。 備考 デフォルトでは、X-Ray SDK は毎秒最初のリクエストと、追加リクエストの 5% を記録します。 常に許容できるリザーバサイズを設定してください。 リザーバサイズは、1 秒あたりにキャプチャする最大リクエスト数を決定します。 これにより、悪意のある攻撃、不要な料金、設定エラーから保護されます。 デーモンの設定​ X-Ray デーモンは、分析のために X-Ray データプレーンにテレメトリを送信する負荷を軽減することを目的としています。 そのため、ソースアプリケーションが実行されているサーバー、コンテナ、またはインスタンスのリソースを過度に消費しないようにする必要があります。 備考 ベストプラクティスは、X-Ray デーモンを別のインスタンスまたはコンテナで実行することです。 これにより、関心の分離を実現し、ソースシステムへの負荷を軽減できます。 備考 Kubernetes などのコンテナオーケストレーションパターンでは、X-Ray デーモンをサイドカーとして運用することが一般的な方法です。 デーモンには安全なデフォルト設定があり、ほとんどの場合、EC2、ECS、EKS、または Fargate 環境で追加の設定なしで動作します。 ただし、ハイブリッド環境やその他のクラウド環境では、Direct Connect や VPN を使用してリモート環境を統合する場合、VPC エンドポイントを反映するように Endpoint を調整することをお勧めします。 ヒント X-Ray デーモンをソースアプリケーションと同じインスタンスまたは仮想マシンで実行する必要がある場合は、TotalBufferSizeMB 設定を使用して、X-Ray が許容できる以上のシステムリソースを消費しないようにすることを検討してください。 アノテーション​ AWS X-Ray では、トレースと一緒に任意のメタデータを送信することができます。これを アノテーション と呼びます。 アノテーションは、トレースを論理的にグループ化できる強力な機能です。 また、アノテーションはインデックス化されるため、単一のエンティティに関連するトレースを簡単に見つけることができます。 X-Ray の自動計測 SDK を使用する場合、アノテーションは自動的には表示されない場合があります。 コードにアノテーションを追加する必要がありますが、これによってトレースが大幅に強化され、X-Ray Insights の生成、アノテーションに基づくメトリクスの作成、システム動作からのアラームと異常検知モデルの作成、そしてユーザーに影響を与えるコンポーネントが観察された際の自動チケット発行と修復が可能になります。 備考 環境内のデータフローを理解するためにアノテーションを使用してください。 備考 アノテーション付きトレースのパフォーマンスと結果に基づいてアラームを作成してください。 このページを編集 前へ

を使用すると、実際のユーザーセッションからウェブアプリケーションのパフォーマンスに関するクライアント側のデータをほぼリアルタイムで収集し、表示できます。 可視化および分析できるデータには、ページの読み込み時間、クライアント側のエラー、ユーザーの行動などが含まれます。 このデータを表示する際、すべてのデータを集約して表示できるだけでなく、お客様が使用しているブラウザやデバイスごとの内訳も確認できます。 Web クライアント​ CloudWatch RUM Web クライアントは、Node.js バージョン 16 以上を使用して開発およびビルドされています。コードは GitHub で公開されています。このクライアントは Angular および React アプリケーションで使用できます。 CloudWatch RUM は、アプリケーションの読み込み時間、パフォーマンス、アンロード時間に認識できる影響を与えないように設計されています。 注記 CloudWatch RUM で収集したエンドユーザーデータは 30 日間保持された後、自動的に削除されます。RUM イベントをより長期間保持したい場合は、アプリモニターがイベントのコピーをアカウントの CloudWatch Logs に送信するように設定できます。 ヒント Web アプリケーションで広告ブロッカーによる潜在的な中断を避けたい場合は、Web クライアントを独自のコンテンツ配信ネットワークまたは Web サイト内でホストすることをお勧めします。GitHub のドキュメントでは、独自のオリジンドメインから Web クライアントをホストするためのガイダンスを提供しています。 アプリケーションの認証​ CloudWatch RUM を使用するには、アプリケーションは以下の 3 つのオプションのいずれかで認証を行う必要があります。 すでにセットアップされている既存の ID プロバイダーからの認証を使用する 既存の Amazon Cognito ID プールを使用する CloudWatch RUM にアプリケーション用の新しい Amazon Cognito ID プールを作成させる 備考 CloudWatch RUM にアプリケーション用の新しい Amazon Cognito ID プールを作成させる方法が、セットアップに最も手間がかかりません。これがデフォルトのオプションです。 ヒント CloudWatch RUM は、未認証ユーザーと認証済みユーザーを分離するように設定できます。詳細については、このブログ記事 を参照してください。 データ保護とプライバシー​ CloudWatch RUM クライアントは、エンドユーザーデータの収集を支援するためにクッキーを使用できます。これはユーザージャーニー機能に役立ちますが、必須ではありません。プライバシー関連情報の詳細なドキュメント をご覧ください。1 ヒント RUM を使用した Web アプリケーションのテレメトリ収集は安全で、コンソールや CloudWatch Logs を通じて個人を特定できる情報 (PII) が公開されることはありません。ただし、Web クライアントを通じてカスタム属性を収集できることに注意してください。このメカニズムを使用して機密データを公開しないよう注意してください。 クライアントコードスニペット​ CloudWatch RUM Web クライアントのコードスニペットは自動的に生成されますが、要件に合わせてクライアントを設定するために手動でコードスニペットを変更することもできます。 備考 シングルページアプリケーションでクッキーの作成を動的に有効にするには、クッキー同意メカニズムを使用してください。詳細については、このブログ記事 を参照してください。 URL 収集の無効化​ 個人情報を含む可能性のあるリソース URL の収集を防止します。 備考 アプリケーションで個人を特定できる情報 (PII) を含む URL を使用している場合は、アプリケーションにコードスニペットを挿入する前に、コードスニペット設定で recordResourceUrl: false を設定して、リソース URL の収集を無効にすることを強くおすすめします。 アクティブトレースの有効化​ Web クライアントで addXRayTraceIdHeader: true を設定することで、エンドツーエンドのトレースを有効にします。これにより、CloudWatch RUM Web クライアントは HTTP リクエストに X-Ray トレースヘッダーを追加します。 このオプション設定を有効にすると、アプリケーションモニターによってサンプリングされたユーザーセッション中の XMLHttpRequest および fetch リクエストがトレースされます。これらのユーザーセッションのトレースとセグメントを、RUM ダッシュボード、CloudWatch ServiceLens コンソール、X-Ray コンソールで確認できます。 AWS コンソールでアプリケーションモニターを設定する際に、アクティブトレースを有効にするチェックボックスをクリックすると、コードスニペットで自動的に設定が有効になります。 スニペットの挿入​ 前のセクションでコピーまたはダウンロードしたコードスニペットを、アプリケーションの <head> 要素内に挿入します。<body> 要素や他の <script> タグの前に挿入してください。 備考 アプリケーションに複数のページがある場合は、すべてのページに含まれる共有ヘッダーコンポーネントにコードスニペットを挿入してください。 警告 Web クライアントを <head> 要素内のできるだけ早い位置に配置することが重要です！パッシブな Web トラッカーが HTML の下部付近に読み込まれるのとは異なり、RUM が最大限のパフォーマンスデータを収集するためには、ページのレンダリングプロセスの早い段階でインスタンス化される必要があります。 カスタムメタデータの使用​ CloudWatch RUM イベントのデフォルトのイベントメタデータにカスタムメタデータを追加できます。 セッション属性は、ユーザーのセッション内のすべてのイベントに追加されます。 ページ属性は、指定されたページにのみ追加されます。 備考 カスタム属性のキー名には、このページに記載されている予約済みキーワードを使用しないようにしてください。 ページグループの使用​ 備考 ページグループを使用して、アプリケーション内の異なるページを相互に関連付けることで、ページグループの集計分析を確認できます。たとえば、タイプと言語別にすべてのページの集計されたページ読み込み時間を確認したい場合があります。 awsRum.recordPageView({ pageId: '/home', pageTags: ['en', 'landing']}) 拡張メトリクスの使用​ CloudWatch RUM によって自動的に収集されるデフォルトのメトリクスのセットがあり、これらは AWS/RUM という名前の名前空間で公開されます。 これらは、RUM がユーザーに代わって作成する無料のベンダーメトリクスです。 備考 CloudWatch RUM メトリクスを追加のディメンションと共に CloudWatch に送信することで、より詳細なメトリクスの表示が可能になります。 拡張メトリクスでは、以下のディメンションがサポートされています： BrowserName CountryCode - ISO-3166 フォーマット (2 文字コード) DeviceType FileType OSName PageId ただし、このページのガイダンスを使用して、独自のメトリクスとアラームを作成することができます。
