However, traces will present a single, cohesive view of the user's entire interaction across that single transaction, spanning all of these discrete components.

This leads to a question as to handling \"bad data\", or data that was inaccurate. With AWS observability services, there is no facility to delete metrics or traces that were emitted in error. CloudWatch Logs does allow for the deletion of an entire log stream, but you cannot retroactively change data once it has been collected.

Likewise, with \"null\" data - even empty timeseries are valuable.

See our documentation for updated list of Regions that we support. We plan to support all commercial regions in 2023. Please let us know which regions you would like so that we can better prioritize our existing Product Feature Requests (PFRs). You can always collect data from any regions and send it to a specific region that we support. Here’s a blog for more details: Cross-region metrics collection for Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. How long does it take to see metering and/or billing in Cost Explorer or **** CloudWatch as AWS billing charges? We meter blocks of ingested metric samples as soon as they are uploaded to S3 every 2 hours. It can take up to 3 hours to see metering and charges reported for Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. As far as I can see the Prometheus Service is only able to scrape metrics from a cluster (EKS/ECS) Is that correct? We apologize for the lack of documentation for other compute environments. You can use Prometheus server to scrape Prometheus metrics from EC2 and any other compute environments where you can install a Prometheus server today as long as you configure the remote write and setup the AWS SigV4 proxy. The link to the EC2 blog has a section “Running aws-sigv4-proxy” that can show you how to run it. We do need to add more documentation to help our customers simplify how to run AWS SigV4 on other compute environments. How would one connect this service to Grafana? Is there some documentation about this? We use the default Prometheus data source available in Grafana to query Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus using PromQL. Here’s some documentation and a blog that will help you get started: Service docs Grafana setup on EC2 What are some of the best practices to reduce the number of samples being sent to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus? To reduce the number of samples being ingested into Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, customers can extend their scrape interval (e.g., change from 30s to 1min) or decrease the number of series they are scraping. Changing the scrape interval will have a more dramatic impact on the number of samples than decreasing the number of series, with doubling the scrape interval halving the volume of samples ingested. How to send CloudWatch metrics to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus? We recommend utilizing CloudWatch metric streams to send CloudWatch metrics to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. Some possible shortcomings of this integration are, A Lambda function is required to call the Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus APIs, No ability to enrich CloudWatch metrics with metadata (e.g., with AWS tags) before ingesting them to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, Metrics can only be filtered by namespace (not granular enough). As an alternative, customers can utilize Prometheus Exporters to send CloudWatch metrics data to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus: (1) CloudWatch Exporter: Java based scraping that uses CW ListMetrics and GetMetricStatistics (GMS) APIs. Yet Another CloudWatch Exporter (YACE) is another option to get metrics from CloudWatch into Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. This is a Go based tool that uses the CW ListMetrics, GetMetricData (GMD), and GetMetricStatistics (GMS) APIs. Some disadvantages in using this could be that you will have to deploy the agent and have to manage the life-cycle yourself which has to be done thoughtfully. **What version of Prometheus are you compatible with? Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is compatible with Prometheus 2.x. Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is based on the open source CNCF Cortex project as its data plane. Cortex strives to be 100% API compatible with Prometheus (under /prometheus/ and /api/prom/). Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus supports Prometheus-compatible PromQL queries and Remote write metric ingestion and the Prometheus data model for existing metric types including Gauge, Counters, Summary, and Histogram. We do not currently expose all Cortex APIs. The list of compatible APIs we support can be found here. Customers can work with their account team to open new or influence existing Product Features Requests (PFRs) if we are missing any features required from Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. **What collector do you recommend for ingesting metrics into Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus? Should I utilize Prometheus in Agent mode? **We support the usage of Prometheus servers inclusive of agent mode, the OpenTelemetry agent, and the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry agent as agents that customers can use to send metrics data to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry is a downstream distribution of the OpenTelemetry project packaged and secured by AWS. Any of the three should be fine, and you’re welcome to pick whichever best suits your individual team’s needs and preferences. How does Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus’s performance scale with the size of a workspace? Currently, Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus supports up to 200M active time series in a single workspace. When we announce a new max limit, we’re ensuring that the performance and reliability properties of the service continue to be maintained across ingest and query. Queries across the same size dataset should not see a performance degradation regardless of the number of active series in a workspace.

We are working on expanding the number and types of AWS services that propagate and/or generate spans. If you have a use case depending on this, please reach out to us. Will I be able to use the W3C trace header to ingest spans into AWS X-Ray using ADOT? Yes, later in 2023. We’re working on supporting W3C trace context propagation. Can I trace requests across Lambda functions when SQS is involved in the middle? Yes. X-Ray now supports tracing across Lambda functions when SQS is involved in the middle. Traces from upstream message producers are automatically linked to traces from downstream Lambda consumer nodes, creating an end-to-end view of the application. Should I use X-Ray SDK or the OTel SDK to instrument my application? OTel offers more features than the X-Ray SDK, but to choose which one is right for your use case see Choosing between ADOT and X-Ray SDK Are span events supported in AWS X-Ray? Span events do not fit into the X-Ray model and are hence dropped. How can I extract data out of AWS X-Ray? You can retrieve Service Graph, Traces and Root cause analytics data using X-Ray APIs. Can I achieve 100% sampling? That is, I want all traces to be recorded without sampling at all. You can adjust the sampling rules to capture significantly increased amount of trace data. As long as the total segments sent do not breach the service quota limits mentioned here, X-Ray will make an effort to collect data as configured. There is no guarantee that this will result in 100% trace data capture as a result. Can I dynamically increase or decrease sampling rules through APIs? Yes, you can use the X-Ray sampling APIs to make adjustments dynamically as necessary. See this blog for a use-case based explanation.

The algorithms create an anomaly detection model that generates a range of expected values that represent normal metric behavior. Customers can create alarm based on the analysis of past metric data and a value set for the anomaly threshold. Related AWS Observability Workshop: Anomaly Detection I’ve setup metric alarm in Amazon CloudWatch, however I’m getting frequent alarm noises. How can I control and fine tune this? Customers can combine multiple alarms into alarm hierarchies as composite alarm to reduce alarm noise by triggering just once when multiple alarms fire simultaneously. Composite alarms support an overall state by helping customers in grouping resources like an application, AWS Region, or AZ. Related AWS Observability Workshop: Alarms My workload facing the internet is experiencing performance and availability issues, how do I troubleshoot? Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor provides visibility into how internet issues impact the performance and availability between your applications hosted on AWS and your end users. With Internet Monitor, you can quickly identify what's impacting your application's performance and availability, so that you can track down and address issues which can significantly reduce the time it takes to diagnose internet issues. I've my workload on AWS and I want to get notified even before the end users experience an impact or latency in accessing the application. How do I get better visibility and improve the observability of my customer facing workload? Customers can use Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to create canaries, configurable scripts that run on a schedule, to monitor your endpoints and APIs. Canaries follow the same routes and perform the same actions as a customer, which makes it possible to continually verify end user experience even when there are no live traffic to your applications. Canaries help you discover issues even before your customers do. Canaries check the availability and latency of endpoints and can store load time data and screenshots of the UI as rendered by a headless Chromium browser. Related AWS Observability Workshop: CloudWatch Synthetics I've my workload on AWS and I want to observe end user experience by identifying client-side performance issues and action a faster resolution if there are any real-time issues. CloudWatch RUM can perform real user monitoring to collect and view client-side data about your web application performance from actual user sessions in near real time. This collected data helps quickly identify and debug client-side performance issues and also helps to visualize and analyze page load times, client-side errors, and user behavior. When viewing this data, customers can see it all aggregated together and also see breakdowns by the browsers and devices that your customers use. CloudWatch RUM helps visualize anomalies in your application performance and find relevant debugging data such as error messages, stack traces, and user sessions. Related AWS Observability Workshop: CloudWatch RUM My Organization requires all actions be recorded for audits. Can Amazon CloudWatch events be recorded? Amazon CloudWatch is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, which provides a record of actions taken by a user, a role, or an AWS service in Amazon CloudWatch. CloudTrail captures all API calls for Amazon CloudWatch as events that include calls from the console and code calls to API operations. What more information is available? For additional information customers can read the AWS Documentation for CloudWatch, CloudWatch Events and CloudWatch Logs, go through the AWS Observability Workshop on AWS Native Observability and also check the product page to know the features, and pricing details.

Not every tool is right for every solution though! To help you navigate through your observability requirements, configuration, and final deployment, we have summarized five key best practices that will inform your decision making process on your Observability strategy.","s":"Best practices overview","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/","h":"","p":30},{"i":33,"t":"The most important consideration with observability is not your servers, network, applications, or customers. It is what matters to you, your business, your project, or your users. Start first with what your success criteria are. For example, if you run an e-commerce application, your measures of success may be number of purchases made over the past hour. If you run a non-profit, then it may be donations vs. your target for the month. A payment processor may watch for transaction processing time, whereas universities would want to measure student attendance. tip Success metrics are different for everyone! We may use an e-commerce application as an example here, but your projects can have a very different measurement. Regardless, the advice remains the same: know what good looks like and measure for it. Regardless of your application, you must start with identifying your key metrics. Then work backwards1 from that to see what impacts it from an application or infrastructure perspective. For example, if high CPU on your web servers endangers customer satisfaction, and in-turn your sales, then monitoring CPU utilization is important! Know your objectives, and measure them!​ Having identified your important top-level KPIs, your next job is to have an automated way to track and measure them. A critical success factor is doing so in the same system that watches your workload's operations. For our e-commerce workload example this may mean: Publishing sales data into a time series Tracking user registrations in this same system Measure how long customers stay on web pages, and (again) push this data to a time series Most customers have this data already, though not necessarily in the right places from an observability perspective. Sales data can typically be found in relational databases or business intelligence reporting systems, along with user registrations. And data from visit duration can be extracted from logs or from Real User Monitoring. Regardless of your metric data's original location or format, it must be maintained as a time series. Every key metric that matters most to you, whether it is business, personal, academic, or for any other purpose, must be in a time series format for you to correlate it with other observability data (sometimes known as signals or telemetry). Figure 1: example of a time series","s":"Monitor what matters","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/","h":"#monitor-what-matters","p":30},{"i":35,"t":"Tool selection is important and has a profound difference in how you operate and remediate problems. But worse than choosing a sub-optimal tool is tooling for all basic signal types. For example, collecting basic logs from a workload, but missing transaction traces, leaves you with a gap. The result is an incohesive view of your entire application experiece. All modern approaches to observability depend on \"connecting the dots\" with application traces. A complete picture of your health and operations requires tools that collect logs, metrics, and traces, and then performs correlation, analysis, anomaly detection, dashboarding, alarms and more. info Some observability solutions may not contain all of the above but are intended to augment, extend, or give added value to existing systems. In all cases, tool interoperability and extensibility is an important consideration when beginning an observability project. Every workload is different, but common tools make for a faster results​ Using a common set of tools across every workload has add benefits such as reducing operational friction and training, and generally you should strive for a reduced number of tools or vendors. Doing so lets you rapidly deploy existing observability solutions to new environments or workloads, and with faster time-to-resolution when things go wrong. Your tools should be broad enough to observe every tier of your workload: basic infrastructure, applications, web sites, and everything in between. In places where a single tool is not possible, the best practice is to use those that have an open standard, are open source, and therefore have the broadest cross-platform integration possibilities. Integrate with existing tools and processes​ Don't reinvent the wheel! \"Round\" is a great shape already, and we should always be building collaborative and open systems, not data silos. Integrate with existing identity providers (e.g. Active Directory, SAML based IdPs). If you have existing IT trouble tracking system (e.g. JIRA, ServiceNow) then integrate with it to quickly manage problems as they arise. Use existing workload management and escalation tools (e.g. PagerDuty, OpsGenie) if you already have them! Infrastructure as code tools such as Ansible, SaltStack, CloudFormation, TerraForm, and CDK are all great tools. Use them to manage your observability as well as everything else, and build your observability solution with the same infrastructure as code tools you already use today (see include observability from day one). Use automation and machine learning​ Computers are good at finding patterns, and at finding when data does not follow a pattern! If you have hundreds, thousands, or even millions of datapoints to monitor, then it would impossible to understand healthy thresholds for every single one of them. But many observability solutions have anomaly detection and machine learning capabilities that manage the undifferentiated heavy lifting of baselining your data. We refer to this as \"knowing what good looks like\". If you have load-tested your workload thoroughly then you may know these healthy performance metrics already, but for a complex distributed application it can be unwieldy to create baselines for every metric. This is where anomaly detection, automation, and machine learning are invaluable. Leverage tools that manage the baselining and alerting of applications health on your behalf, thereby letting you focus on your goals, and monitor what matters.","s":"Context propagation and tool selection","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/","h":"#context-propagation-and-tool-selection","p":30},{"i":37,"t":"Your applications do not exist in isolation, and interactions with your network infrastructure, cloud providers, internet service providers, SasS partners, and other components both within and outside your control can all impact your outcomes. It is important that you have a holistic view of your entire workload. Focus on integrations​ If you have to pick one area to instrument, it will undoubtedly be your integrations between components. This is where the power of observability is most evident. As a rule, every time one component or service calls another, that call must have at least these data points measured: The duration of the request and response The status of the response And to create the cohesive, holistic view that observability requires, a single unique identier for the entire request chain must be included in the signals collected. Don't forget about the end-user experience​ Having a complete view of your workload means understanding it at all tiers, including how your end users experience it. Measuring, quantifying, and understanding when your objectives are at risk from a poor user experience is just as important as watching for free disk space or CPU utilization - if not more important! If your workloads are ones that interact directly with the end user (such as any application served as a web site or mobile app) then Real User Monitoring monitors not just the \"last mile\" of delivery to the user, but how they actually have experienced your application.

Adding transaction tracing after major development work is done takes time, even with auto-instrumentation. The effort returns far greater returns! But doing so late in your development cycle may create some rework. Rather than bolting observability in your workload later one, use it to help accelerate your work. Proper logging, metric, and trace collection enables faster application development, fosters good practices, and lays the foundation for rapid problem solving going forward.

These tools are not mutually-exclusive, and you can mix them together as necessary. And there is a best practice for making this selection. However, first you should understand the current state of OpenTelemetry (OTEL). OTEL is the current industry standard specification for observabillity signalling, and contains definitions for each of the three core signal types: metrics, traces, and logs. However, OTEL has not always existed and has evolved out of earlier specifications such as OpenMetrics and OpenTracing. Observability vendors began openly supporting OpenTelemetry Line Protocol (OTLP) in recent years. AWS X-Ray and CloudWatch pre-date the OTEL specification, as do other leading observability solutions. However, the AWS X-Ray service readily accepts OTEL traces using ADOT. ADOT has the integrations already built into it to emit telemetry into X-Ray directly, as well as to other ISV solutions. Any transaction tracing solution requires an agent and an integration into the underlying application in order to collect signals. And this, in turn, creates technical debt in the form of libraries that must be tested, maintained, and upgraded, as well as possibly retooling if you choose to change your solution in the future. The SDKs included with X-Ray are part of a tightly integrated instrumentation solution offered by AWS. ADOT is part of a broader industry solution in which X-Ray is only one of many tracing solutions. You can implement end-to-end tracing in X-Ray using either approach, but it’s important to understand the differences in order to determine the most useful approach for you. info We recommend instrumenting your application with the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry if you need the following: The ability to send traces to multiple different tracing backends without having to re-instrument your code.

To setup the agent for file-based discovery of targets, the agent needs two configuration parameters, which are both defined in the task definition used for launching the agent.

AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) is a secure, AWS-supported distribution of the OpenTelemetry project. With ADOT, users can instrument their applications just once to send correlated metrics and traces to multiple monitoring solutions. With ADOT support for CloudWatch Container Insights, customers can collect system metrics such as CPU, memory, disk, and network usage from Amazon EKS clusters running on Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (Amazon EC2), providing the same experience as Amazon CloudWatch agent. ADOT Collector is now available with support for CloudWatch Container Insights for Amazon EKS and AWS Fargate profile for Amazon EKS. Customers can now collect container and pod metrics such as CPU and memory utilization for their pods that are deployed to an Amazon EKS cluster and view them in CloudWatch dashboards without any changes to their existing CloudWatch Container Insights experience. This will enable customers to also determine whether to scale up or down to respond to traffic and save costs. The ADOT Collector has the concept of a pipeline which comprises three key types of components, namely, receiver, processor, and exporter. A receiver is how data gets into the collector. It accepts data in a specified format, translates it into the internal format and passes it to processors and exporters defined in the pipeline. It can be pull or push based. A processor is an optional component that is used to perform tasks such as batching, filtering, and transformations on data between being received and being exported. An exporter is used to determine which destination to send the metrics, logs or traces. The collector architecture allows multiple instances of such pipelines to be defined via YAML configuration. The following diagrams illustrates the pipeline components in an ADOT Collector instance deployed to Amazon EKS and Amazon EKS with Fargate profile. Figure: Pipeline components in an ADOT Collector instance deployed to Amazon EKS In the above architecture, we are deploying we are using an instance of AWS Container Insights Receiver in the pipeline and collect the metrics directly from the Kubelet. AWS Container Insights Receiver (awscontainerinsightreceiver) is an AWS specific receiver that supports CloudWatch Container Insights. CloudWatch Container Insights collect, aggregate, and summarize metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices. Data are collected as as performance log events using embedded metric format. From the EMF data, Amazon CloudWatch can create the aggregated CloudWatch metrics at the cluster, node, pod, task, and service level. Below is an example of a sample awscontainerinsightreceiver configuration : receivers: awscontainerinsightreceiver: # all parameters are optional collection_interval: 60s container_orchestrator: eks add_service_as_attribute: true prefer_full_pod_name: false add_full_pod_name_metric_label: false This entails deploying the collector as a DaemonSet using the above configuration on Amazon EKS. You will also have access to a fuller set of metrics collected by this receiver directly from the Kubelet. Having more than one instances of ADOT Collector will suffice to collect resource metrics from all the nodes in a cluster. Having a single instance of ADOT collector can be overwhelming during higher loads so always recommend to deploy more than one collector. Figure: Pipeline components in an ADOT Collector instance deployed to Amazon EKS with Fargate profile In the above architecture, the kubelet on a worker node in a Kubernetes cluster exposes resource metrics such as CPU, memory, disk, and network usage at the /metrics/cadvisor endpoint. However, in EKS Fargate networking architecture, a pod is not allowed to directly reach the kubelet on that worker node. Hence, the ADOT Collector calls the Kubernetes API Server to proxy the connection to the kubelet on a worker node, and collect kubelet’s cAdvisor metrics for workloads on that node. These metrics are made available in Prometheus format. Therefore, the collector uses an instance of Prometheus Receiver as a drop-in replacement for a Prometheus server and scrapes these metrics from the Kubernetes API server endpoint. Using Kubernetes service discovery, the receiver can discover all the worker nodes in an EKS cluster. Hence, more than one instances of ADOT Collector will suffice to collect resource metrics from all the nodes in a cluster. Having a single instance of ADOT collector can be overwhelming during higher loads so always recommend to deploy more than one collector. The metrics then go through a series of processors that perform filtering, renaming, data aggregation and conversion, and so on. The following is the list of processors used in the pipeline of an ADOT Collector instance for Amazon EKS illustrated above. Filter Processor is part of the AWS OpenTelemetry distribution to include or exclude metrics based on their name. It can be used as part of the metrics collection pipeline to filter out unwanted metrics. For example, suppose that you want Container Insights to only collect pod-level metrics (with name prefix pod_) excluding those for networking, with name prefix pod_network. # filter out only renamed metrics which we care about filter: metrics: include: match_type: regexp metric_names: - new_container_.* - pod_.* Metrics Transform Processor can be used to rename metrics, and add, rename or delete label keys and values. It can also be used to perform scaling and aggregations on metrics across labels or label values. metricstransform/rename: transforms: - include: container_spec_cpu_quota new_name: new_container_cpu_limit_raw action: insert match_type: regexp experimental_match_labels: {\"container\": \"\\\\S\"} Cumulative to Delta Processor converts monotonic, cumulative sum and histogram metrics to monotonic, delta metrics. Non-monotonic sums and exponential histograms are excluded. ` # convert cumulative sum datapoints to delta cumulativetodelta: metrics: - pod_cpu_usage_seconds_total - pod_network_rx_errors` Delta to Rate Processor to convert delta sum metrics to rate metrics. This rate is a gauge. ` # convert delta to rate deltatorate: metrics: - pod_memory_hierarchical_pgfault - pod_memory_hierarchical_pgmajfault - pod_network_rx_bytes - pod_network_rx_dropped - pod_network_rx_errors - pod_network_tx_errors - pod_network_tx_packets - new_container_memory_pgfault - new_container_memory_pgmajfault - new_container_memory_hierarchical_pgfault - new_container_memory_hierarchical_pgmajfault` Metrics Generation Processor can be used to create new metrics using existing metrics following a given rule. experimental_metricsgeneration/1: rules: - name: pod_memory_utilization_over_pod_limit unit: Percent type: calculate metric1: pod_memory_working_set metric2: pod_memory_limit operation: percent The final component in the pipeline is AWS CloudWatch EMF Exporter, which converts the metrics to embedded metric format (EMF) and then sends them directly to CloudWatch Logs using the PutLogEvents API. The following list of metrics is sent to CloudWatch by the ADOT Collector for each of the workloads running on Amazon EKS. pod_cpu_utilization_over_pod_limit pod_cpu_usage_total pod_cpu_limit pod_memory_utilization_over_pod_limit pod_memory_working_set pod_memory_limit pod_network_rx_bytes pod_network_tx_bytes Each metric will be associated with the following dimension sets and collected under the CloudWatch namespace named ContainerInsights.

It’s also fully compatible with Docker and Kubernetes environments. Using the newly launched Fluent Bit daemonset, you can send container logs from your EKS clusters to CloudWatch logs for logs storage and analytics. Due to its lightweight nature, using Fluent Bit as the default log forwarder in Container Insights on EKS worker nodes will allow you to stream application logs into CloudWatch logs efficiently and reliably. With Fluent Bit, Container Insights is able to deliver thousands of business critical logs at scale in a resource efficient manner, especially in terms of CPU and memory utilization at the pod level. In other words, compared to FluentD, which was the log forwarder used prior, Fluent Bit has a smaller resource footprint and, as a result, is more resource efficient for memory and CPU. On the other hand, AWS for Fluent Bit image, which includes Fluent Bit and related plugins, gives Fluent Bit an additional flexibility of adopting new AWS features faster as the image aims to provide a unified experience within AWS ecosystem. The architecture below shows individual components used by CloudWatch Container Insights for EKS: Figure: Individual components used by CloudWatch Container Insights for EKS. While working with containers, it is recommended to push all the logs, including application logs, through the standard output (stdout) and standard error output (stderr) methods whenever possible using the Docker JSON logging driver. For this reason, in EKS, the logging driver is configured by default and everything that a containerized application writes to stdout or stderr is streamed into a JSON file under “/var/log/containers\" on the worker node. Container Insights classifies those logs into three different categories by default and creates dedicated input streams for each category within Fluent Bit and independent log groups within CloudWatch Logs. Those categories are: Application logs: All applications logs stored under “/var/log/containers/*.log\" are streamed into the dedicated /aws/containerinsights/Cluster_Name/application log group. All non-application logs such as kube-proxy and aws-node logs are excluded by default. However, additional Kubernetes add-on logs, such as CoreDNS logs, are also processed and streamed into this log group. Host logs: system logs for each EKS worker node are streamed into the /aws/containerinsights/Cluster_Name/host log group. These system logs include the contents of “/var/log/messages,/var/log/dmesg,/var/log/secure” files. Considering the stateless and dynamic nature of containerized workloads, where EKS worker nodes are often being terminated during scaling activities, streaming those logs in real time with Fluent Bit and having those logs available in CloudWatch logs, even after the node is terminated, are critical in terms of observability and monitoring health of EKS worker nodes. It also enables you to debug or troubleshoot cluster issues without logging into worker nodes in many cases and analyze these logs in more systematic way. Data plane logs: EKS already provides control plane logs. With Fluent Bit integration in Container Insights, the logs generated by EKS data plane components, which run on every worker node and are responsible for maintaining running pods are captured as data plane logs. These logs are also streamed into a dedicated CloudWatch log group under ‘ /aws/containerinsights/Cluster_Name/dataplane. kube-proxy, aws-node, and Docker runtime logs are saved into this log group. In addition to control plane logs, having data plane logs stored in CloudWatch Logs helps to provide a complete picture of your EKS clusters. Further, Please learn more on topics such as Fluent Bit Configurations, Fluent Bit Monitoring and Log analysis from Fluent Bit Integration with Amazon EKS.","s":"Fluent Bit Integration in CloudWatch Container Insights for Amazon EKS","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/containers/aws-native/eks/amazon-cloudwatch-container-insights","h":"#fluent-bit-integration-in-cloudwatch-container-insights-for-amazon-eks","p":66},{"i":75,"t":"With the default configuration, the Container Insights receiver collects the complete set of metrics as defined by the receiver documentation. The number of metrics and dimensions collected is high, and for large clusters this will significantly increase the costs for metric ingestion and storage. We are going to demonstrate two different approaches that you can use to configure the ADOT Collector to send only metrics that bring value and saves cost. Using processors​ This approach involves the introduction of OpenTelemetry processors as discussed above to filter out metrics or attributes to reduce the size of EMF logs. We will demonstrate the basic usage of two processors namely Filter and Resource. Filter processors can be included in the ConfigMap named otel-agent-conf: processors: # filter processors example filter/include: # any names NOT matching filters are excluded from remainder of pipeline metrics: include: match_type: regexp metric_names: # re2 regexp patterns - ^pod_.* filter/exclude: # any names matching filters are excluded from remainder of pipeline metrics: exclude: match_type: regexp metric_names: - ^pod_network.* Resource processor is also built into the AWS OpenTelemetry Distro and can be used to remove unwanted metric attributes. For example, if you want to remove the Kubernetes and Sources fields from the EMF logs, you can add the resource processor to the pipeline: # resource processors example resource: attributes: - key: Sources action: delete - key: kubernetes action: delete Customize Metrics and Dimensions​ In this approach, you will configure the CloudWatch EMF exporter to generate only the set of metrics that you want to send to CloudWatch Logs. The metric_declaration section of CloudWatch EMF exporter configuration can be used to define the set of metrics and dimensions that you want to export. For example, you can keep only pod metrics from the default configuration. This metric_declaration section will look like the following and to reduce the number of metrics, you can keep the dimension set only [PodName, Namespace, ClusterName] if you do not care about others: awsemf: namespace: ContainerInsights log_group_name: '/aws/containerinsights/{ClusterName}/performance' log_stream_name: '{NodeName}' resource_to_telemetry_conversion: enabled: true dimension_rollup_option: NoDimensionRollup parse_json_encoded_attr_values: [Sources, kubernetes] # Customized metric declaration section metric_declarations: # pod metrics - dimensions: [[PodName, Namespace, ClusterName]] metric_name_selectors: - pod_cpu_utilization - pod_memory_utilization - pod_cpu_utilization_over_pod_limit - pod_memory_utilization_over_pod_limit This configuration will produce and stream the following four metrics within single dimension [PodName, Namespace, ClusterName] rather than 55 different metrics for multiple dimensions in the default configuration: pod_cpu_utilization pod_memory_utilization pod_cpu_utilization_over_pod_limit pod_memory_utilization_over_pod_limit With this configuration, you will only send the metrics that you are interested in rather than all the metrics configured by default. As a result, you will be able to decrease metric ingestion cost for Container Insights considerably. Having this flexibility will provide Container Insights costumers with high level of control over metrics being exported. Customizing metrics by modifying the awsemf exporter configuration is also highly flexible, and you can customize both the metrics that you want to send and their dimensions. Note that this is only applicable to logs that are sent to CloudWatch. The two approaches demonstrated discussed above are not mutually exclusive with each other. In fact, they both can be combined for a high degree of flexibility in customizing metrics that we want ingested into our monitoring system. We use this approach to decrease costs associated with metric storage and processing, as show in following graph. Figure: AWS Cost Explorer In the preceding AWS Cost Explorer graph, we can see daily cost associated with CloudWatch using different configurations on the ADOT Collector in a small EKS cluster (20 Worker nodes, 220 pods). Aug 15th shows CloudWatch bill using ADOT Collector with the default configuration. On Aug 16th, we have used the Customize EMF exporter approach and can see about 30% cost savings. On Aug 17th, we used the Processors approach, which achieves about 45% costs saving. You must consider the trade-offs of customizing metrics sent by Container Insights as you will be able to decrease monitoring costs by sacrificing visibility of the monitored cluster. But also, the built-in dashboard provided by Container Insights within the AWS Console can be impacted by customized metrics as you can select not sending metrics and dimensions used by the dashboard.

Instrumenting your application involves sending trace data for incoming and outbound requests and other events within your application, along with metadata about each request. Many instrumentation scenarios require only configuration changes. For example, you can instrument all incoming HTTP requests and downstream calls to AWS services that your Java application makes. There are several SDKs, agents, and tools that can be used to instrument your application for X-Ray tracing. See Instrumenting your application for more information.

With X-Ray, every request can be traced as it flows through the involved microservices. This provides your DevOps teams the insights they need to understand how your services interact with their peers and enables them to analyze and debug issues much faster. AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) is a secure, AWS-supported distribution of the OpenTelemetry project. Users can instrument their applications just once and, using ADOT, send correlated metrics and traces to multiple monitoring solutions. Amazon EKS now allows users to enable ADOT as an add-on at any time after the cluster is up and running. The ADOT add-on includes the latest security patches and bug fixes and is validated by AWS to work with Amazon EKS. The ADOT add-on is an implementation of a Kubernetes Operator, which is a software extension to Kubernetes that makes use of custom resources to manage applications and their components. The add-on watches for a custom resource named OpenTelemetryCollector and manages the lifecycle of an ADOT Collector based on the configuration settings specified in the custom resource. The ADOT Collector has the concept of a pipeline that comprises three key types of components, namely, receiver, processor, and exporter. A receiver is how data gets into the collector. It accepts data in a specific format, translates it into the internal format, and passes it to processors and exporters defined in the pipeline. It can be pull- or push-based. A processor is an optional component that is used to perform tasks such as batching, filtering, and transformations on data between being received and being exported. An exporter is used to determine which destination to send the metrics, logs, or traces to. The collector architecture allows multiple instances of such pipelines to be set up via a Kubernetes YAML manifest. The following diagram illustrates an ADOT Collector configured with a traces pipeline, which sends telemetry data to AWS X-Ray. The traces pipeline comprises an instance of AWS X-Ray Receiver and AWS X-Ray Exporter and sends traces to AWS X-Ray. Figure: Traces collection using Amazon EKS add-ons for AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry. Let’s delve into the details of installing the ADOT add-on in an EKS cluster and then collect telemetry data from workloads. The following is a list of prerequisites needed before we can install the ADOT add-on. An EKS cluster supporting Kubernetes version 1.19 or higher. You may create the EKS cluster using one of the approaches outlined here. Certificate Manager, if not already installed in the cluster. It can be installed with the default configuration as per this documentation. Kubernetes RBAC permissions specifically for EKS add-ons to install the ADOT add-on in your cluster. This can be done by applying the settings in this YAML file to the cluster using a CLI tool such as kubectl. You can check the list of add-ons enabled for different versions of EKS using the following command: aws eks describe-addon-versions The JSON output should list the ADOT add-on among others, as shown below. Note that when an EKS cluster is created, EKS add-ons does not install any add-ons on it. { \"addonName\":\"adot\", \"type\":\"observability\", \"addonVersions\":[ { \"addonVersion\":\"v0.45.0-eksbuild.1\", \"architecture\":[ \"amd64\" ], \"compatibilities\":[ { \"clusterVersion\":\"1.22\", \"platformVersions\":[ \"*\" ], \"defaultVersion\":true }, { \"clusterVersion\":\"1.21\", \"platformVersions\":[ \"*\" ], \"defaultVersion\":true }, { \"clusterVersion\":\"1.20\", \"platformVersions\":[ \"*\" ], \"defaultVersion\":true }, { \"clusterVersion\":\"1.19\", \"platformVersions\":[ \"*\" ], \"defaultVersion\":true } ] } ] } Next, you can install the ADOT add-on with the following command : aws eks create-addon --addon-name adot --addon-version v0.45.0-eksbuild.1 --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME The version string must match the value of addonVersion field in the previously shown output. The output from a successful execution of this command looks as follows: { \"addon\": { \"addonName\": \"adot\", \"clusterName\": \"k8s-production-cluster\", \"status\": \"ACTIVE\", \"addonVersion\": \"v0.45.0-eksbuild.1\", \"health\": { \"issues\": [] }, \"addonArn\": \"arn:aws:eks:us-east-1:123456789000:addon/k8s-production-cluster/adot/f0bff97c-0647-ef6f-eecf-0b2a13f7491b\", \"createdAt\": \"2022-04-04T10:36:56.966000+05:30\", \"modifiedAt\": \"2022-04-04T10:38:09.142000+05:30\", \"tags\": {} } } Wait until the add-on is in ACTIVE status before proceeding to the next step. The status of the add-on can be checked using the following command ; aws eks describe-addon --addon-name adot --cluster-name $CLUSTER_NAME Deploying the ADOT Collector​ The ADOT add-on is an implementation of a Kubernetes Operator, which is a software extension to Kubernetes that makes use of custom resources to manage applications and their components. The add-on watches for a custom resource named OpenTelemetryCollector and manages the lifecycle of an ADOT Collector based on the configuration settings specified in the custom resource. The following figure shows an illustration of how this works. Figure: Deploying the ADOT Collector. Next, let’s take a look at how to deploy an ADOT Collector. The YAML configuration file here defines an OpenTelemetryCollector custom resource. When deployed to an EKS cluster, this will trigger the ADOT add-on to provision an ADOT Collector that includes a traces and metrics pipelines with components, as shown in the first illustration above. The collector is launched into the aws-otel-eks namespace as a Kubernetes Deployment with the name ${custom-resource-name}-collector. A ClusterIP service with the same name is launched as well. Let’s look into the individual components that make up the pipelines of this collector. The AWS X-Ray Receiver in the traces pipeline accepts segments or spans in X-Ray Segment format, which enables it to process segments sent by microservices instrumented with X-Ray SDK. It is configured to listen for traffic on UDP port 2000 and is exposed as a Cluster IP service. Per this configuration, workloads that want to send trace data to this receiver should be configured with the environment variable AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS set to observability-collector.aws-otel-eks:2000. The exporter sends these segments directly to X-Ray using the PutTraceSegments API. ADOT Collector is configured to be launched under the identity of a Kubernetes service account named aws-otel-collector, which is granted these permissions using a ClusterRoleBinding and ClusterRole, also shown in the configuration. The exporters need IAM permissions to send data to X-Ray. This is done by associating the service account with an IAM role using the IAM roles for service accounts feature supported by EKS. The IAM role should be associated with the AWS-managed policies such as AWSXRayDaemonWriteAccess. The helper script here may be used, after setting the CLUSTER_NAME and REGION variables, to create an IAM role named EKS-ADOT-ServiceAccount-Role that is granted these permissions and is associated with the aws-otel-collector service account. End-to-end test of traces collection​ Let’s now put all this together and test traces collection from workloads deployed to an EKS cluster. The following illustration shows the setup employed for this test. It comprises a front-end service that exposes a set of REST APIs and interacts with S3 as well as a datastore service that, in turn, interacts with an instance of Aurora PostgreSQL database. The services are instrumented with X-Ray SDK. ADOT Collector is launched in Deployment mode by deploying an OpenTelemetryCollector custom resource using the YAML manifest that was discussed in the last section. Postman client is used as an external traffic generator, targeting the front-end service. Figure: End-to-end test of traces collection. The following image shows the service graph generated by X-Ray using the segment data captured from the services, with the average response latency for each segment. Figure: CloudWatch Service Map console.* Please check on Traces pipeline with OTLP Receiver and AWS X-Ray Exporter sending traces to AWS X-Ray for OpenTelemetryCollector custom resource definitions that pertain to traces pipeline configurations.

That operator deploys a DaemonSet to your cluster that might be using malformed requests, a needlessly high volume of LIST calls, or maybe each of its DaemonSets across all your 1,000 nodes are requesting status of all 50,000 pods on your cluster every minute! Does this really happen often? Yes, it does! Let’s take a quick detour on how that happens. Understanding LIST vs. WATCH​ Some applications need to understand the state of the objects in your cluster. For example, your machine learning (ML) application wants to know the job status by understanding how many pods are not in the Completed status. In Kubernetes, there are well-behaved ways to do this with something called a WATCH, and some not-so-well-behaved ways that list every object on the cluster to find the latest status on those pods. A well-behaved WATCH​ Using a WATCH or a single, long-lived connection to receive updates via a push model is the most scalable way to do updates in Kubernetes. To oversimplify, we ask for the full state of the system, then only update the object in a cache when changes are received for that object, periodically running a re-sync to ensure that no updates were missed. In the below image we use the apiserver_longrunning_gauge to get an idea of the number of these long-lived connections across both API servers. Figure: apiserver_longrunning_gauge metric Even with this efficient system, we can still have too much of a good thing. For example, if we use many very small nodes, each using two or more DaemonSets that need to talk to the API server, it is quite easy to dramatically increase the number of WATCH calls on the system unnecessarily. For example, let’s look at the difference between eight xlarge nodes vs. a single 8xlarge. Here we see an 8x increase of WATCH calls on the system. Figure: WATCH calls between 8 xlarge nodes. Now these are efficient calls, but what if instead they were the ill-behaved calls we alluded to earlier? Imagine if one of the above DaemonSets on each of the 1,000 nodes is requesting updates on each of the total 50,000 pods in the cluster. We will explore this idea of an unbounded list call in next section. A quick word of caution before continuing, the type of consolidation in the above example must be done with great care, and has many other factors to consider. Everything from the delay of the number of threads competing for a limited number of CPUs on the system, Pod churn rate, to the maximum number of volume attachments a node can handle safely. However, our focus will be on the metrics that lead us to actionable steps that can prevent issues from happening—and maybe give us new insight into our designs. The WATCH metric is a simple one, but it can be used to track and reduce the number of watches, if that is a problem for you.

That will vary depending on how many agents are requesting data, how often they are doing so, and how much data they are requesting. Are they asking for everything on the cluster, or just a single namespace? Does that happen every minute, on very node? Let’s use an example of a logging agent that is appending Kubernetes metadata on every log sent from a node. This could be an overwhelming amount of data in larger clusters. There are many ways for the agent to get that data via a list call, so let’s look at a few. The below request is asking for pods from a specific namespace. /api/v1/namespaces/my-namespace/pods Next, we request all 50,000 pods on the cluster, but in chunks of 500 pods at a time. /api/v1/pods?limit=500 The next call is the most disruptive. Fetching all 50,000 pods on the entire cluster at the same time. /api/v1/pods This happens quite commonly in the field and can be seen in the logs.","s":"Understanding Unbounded list calls to API Server","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/containers/aws-native/eks/eks-api-server-monitoring","h":"#understanding-unbounded-list-calls-to-api-server","p":90},{"i":101,"t":"How can we protect our cluster from such bad behavior? Before Kubernetes 1.20, the API server would protect itself by limiting the number of inflight requests processed per second. Since etcd can only handle so many requests at one time in a performant way, we need to ensure the number of requests is limited to a value per second that keeps etcd reads and writes in a reasonable latency band. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, there is no dynamic way to do this. In the below chart we see a breakdown of read requests, which has a default maximum of 400 inflight request per API server and a default max of 200 concurrent write requests. In a default EKS cluster you will see two API servers for a total of 800 reads and 400 writes. However, caution is advised as these servers can have asymmetric loads on them at different times like right after an upgrade, etc. Figure: Grafana chart with breakdown of read requests. It turns out that the above was not a perfect scheme. For example, how could we keep this badly behaving new operator we just installed from taking up all the inflight write requests on the API server and potentially delaying important requests such as node keepalive messages?","s":"Stopping bad behavior to API Server","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/containers/aws-native/eks/eks-api-server-monitoring","h":"#stopping-bad-behavior-to-api-server","p":90},{"i":103,"t":"Instead of worrying about how many read/write requests were open per second, what if we treated the capacity as one total number, and each application on the cluster got a fair percentage or share of that total maximum number? To do that that effectively, we would need to identify who sent the request to the API server, then give that request a name tag of sorts. With this new name tag, we could then see all these requests are coming from a new agent we will call “Chatty.” Now we can group all of Chatty’s requests into something called a flow, that identifies those requests are coming from the same DaemonSet. This concept now gives us the ability to restrict this bad agent and ensure it does not consume the whole cluster. However, not all requests are created equal. The control plane traffic that is needed to keep the cluster operational should be a higher priority than our new operator. This is where the idea of priority levels comes into play. What if, by default, we had a several “buckets” or queues for critical, high, and low priority traffic? We do not want the chatty agent flow getting a fair share of traffic in the critical traffic queue. We can however put that traffic in a low priority queue so that flow is competing with perhaps other chatty agents. We then would want to ensure that each priority level had the right number of shares or percentage of the overall maximum the API server can handle to ensure the requests were not too delayed. Priority and fairness in action​ Since this is a relatively new feature, many existing dashboards will use the older model of maximum inflight reads and maximum inflight writes. Why this can be problematic? What if we were giving high priority name tags to everything in the kube-system namespace, but we then installed that bad agent into that important namespace, or even simply deployed too many applications in that namespace? We could end up having the same problem we were trying to avoid! So best to keep a close eye on such situations. I have broken out for you some of the metrics I find most interesting to track these kinds of issues. What percentage of a priority group’s shares are used? What is the longest time a request waited in a queue? Which flow is using the most shares? Are there unexpected delays on the system? Percent in use​ Here we see the different default priority groups on the cluster and what percentage of the max is used. Figure: Priority groups on the cluster. Time request was in queue​ How long in seconds the request sat in the priority queue before being processed. Figure: Time the request was in priority queue.

It’s important to remember that our dashboard designs are simply trying to get a quick snapshot if there is a problem we should be investigating. For detailed analysis, we would use ad-hoc queries with PromQL—or better yet, logging queries. What are some ideas for the high-level metrics we would want to look at? What API call is taking the most time to complete? What is the call doing? (Listing objects, deleting them, etc.) What objects is it trying to do that operation on? (Pods, Secrets, ConfigMaps, etc.) Is there a latency problem on the API server itself? Is there a delay in one of my priority queues causing a backup in requests? Does it just look like API server is slow because the etcd server is experiencing latency? Slowest API call​ In the below chart we are looking for the API calls that took the most time to complete for that period. In this case we see a custom resource definition (CRD) is calling a LIST function that is the most latent call during the 05:40 time frame. Armed with this data we can use CloudWatch Insights to pull LIST requests from the audit log in that timeframe to see which application this might be. Figure: Top 5 slowest API calls. API Request Duration​ This API latency chart helps us to understand if any requests are approaching the timeout value of one minute. I like the histogram over time format below as I can see outliers in the data that a line graph would hide. Figure: API Request duration heatmap. Simply hovering over a bucket shows us the exact number of calls that took around 25 milliseconds. [Image: Image.jpg]Figure: Calls over 25 milliseconds. This concept is important when we are working with other systems that cache requests. Cache requests will be fast; we do not want to merge those request latencies with slower requests. Here we can see two distinct bands of latency, requests that have been cached, and those that have not. Figure: Latency, requests cached. ETCD Request Duration​ ETCD latency is one of the most important factors in Kubernetes performance. Amazon EKS allows you see this performance from the API server’s perspective by looking at the request_duration_seconds_bucket metric. Figure : request_duration_seconds_bucket metric. We can now start to put the things we learned together by seeing if certain events are correlated. In the below chart we see API server latency, but we also see much of this latency is coming from the etcd server.

The Kubernetes control plane is a set of components that manage Kubernetes clusters and produce logs used for auditing and diagnostic purposes. With Amazon EKS, you can turn on logs for different control plane components and send them to CloudWatch. Kubernetes also runs system components such as kubelet and kube-proxy on each Kubernetes node that runs your pods. These components write logs within each node and you can configure CloudWatch and Container Insights to capture these logs for each Amazon EKS node. Containers are grouped as pods within a Kubernetes cluster and are scheduled to run on your Kubernetes nodes. Most containerized applications write to standard output and standard error, and the container engine redirects the output to a logging driver. In Kubernetes, the container logs are found in the /var/log/pods directory on a node. You can configure CloudWatch and Container Insights to capture these logs for each of your Amazon EKS pods. There are three common approaches for capturing logs Shipping container logs to a centralized log aggregation system in Kubernetes: Node level agent, like a Fluentd daemonset. This is the recommended pattern. Sidecar container, like a Fluentd sidecar container. Directly writing to log collection system. In this approach, the application is responsible for shipping the logs. This is the least recommended option because you will have to include the log aggregation system’s SDK in your application code instead of reusing community build solutions like Fluentd. This pattern also disobeys the principle of separation of concerns, according to which, logging implementation should be independent of the application. Doing so allows you to change the logging infrastructure without impacting or changing your application. We will now dive in to each of these logging categories for Amazon EKS logging along with talking about unified log aggregation from Amazon EKS and other compute platforms.","s":"Introduction","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/containers/aws-native/eks/log-aggregation","h":"#introduction","p":109},{"i":114,"t":"An Amazon EKS cluster consists of a high availability, single-tenant control plane for your Kubernetes cluster and the Amazon EKS nodes that run your containers. The control plane nodes run in an account managed by AWS. The Amazon EKS cluster control plane nodes are integrated with CloudWatch and you can turn on logging for specific control plane components. Logs are provided for each Kubernetes control plane component instance. AWS manages the health of your control plane nodes and provides a service-level agreement (SLA) for the Kubernetes endpoint. Amazon EKS control plane logging consists of following cluster control plane log types. Each log type corresponds to a component of the Kubernetes control plane. To learn more about these components, see Kubernetes Components in the Kubernetes documentation. API server (api) – Your cluster's API server is the control plane component that exposes the Kubernetes API. If you enable API server logs when you launch the cluster, or shortly thereafter, the logs include API server flags that were used to start the API server. For more information, see kube-apiserver and the audit policy in the Kubernetes documentation. Audit (audit) – Kubernetes audit logs provide a record of the individual users, administrators, or system components that have affected your cluster. For more information, see Auditing in the Kubernetes documentation. Authenticator (authenticator) – Authenticator logs are unique to Amazon EKS. These logs represent the control plane component that Amazon EKS uses for Kubernetes Role Based Access Control (RBAC) authentication using IAM credentials. For more information, see Cluster management. Controller manager (controllerManager) – The controller manager manages the core control loops that are shipped with Kubernetes. For more information, see kube-controller-manager in the Kubernetes documentation. Scheduler (scheduler) – The scheduler component manages when and where to run pods in your cluster. For more information, see kube-scheduler in the Kubernetes documentation. Please follow enabling and disabling control plane logs section and enable control plane logs via AWS console or via AWS CLI. Querying control plane logs from CloudWatch console​ After you enable control plane logging on your Amazon EKS cluster, you can find EKS control plane logs in the /aws/eks/cluster-name/cluster log group. For more information, see Viewing cluster control plane logs. Please make sure to replace cluster-name with your cluster's name. You can use CloudWatch Logs Insights to search through the EKS control plane log data. For more information, see Analyzing log data with CloudWatch Insights. It is important to node that, you can view log events in CloudWatch Logs only after you turn on control plane logging in a cluster. Before you select a time range to run queries in CloudWatch Logs Insights, verify that you turned on control plane logging. Please check the screenshot below showing an example of a EKS control plane log query with query output. Figure: CloudWatch Logs Insights.

Container Insights implements cluster, node, and pod-level metrics with the CloudWatch agent, and Fluent Bit or Fluentd for log capture to CloudWatch. Container Insights also provides automatic dashboards with layered views of your captured CloudWatch metrics. Container Insights is deployed as CloudWatch DaemonSet and Fluent Bit DaemonSet that runs on every Amazon EKS node. Fargate nodes are not supported by Container Insights because the nodes are managed by AWS and don’t support DaemonSets. Fargate logging for Amazon EKS is covered separately in this guide.

To collect application logs you must install a log aggregator, such as Fluent Bit, Fluentd, or CloudWatch Container Insights, in your Amazon EKS cluster. Fluent Bit is an open-source log processor and forwarder that is written in C++, which means that you can collect data from different sources, enrich them with filters, and send them to multiple destinations. By using this guide's solution you can enable aws-for-fluent-bit or fargate-fluentbit for logging. Fluentd is an open-source data collector for unified logging layer and written in Ruby. Fluentd acts as a unified logging layer that can aggregate data from multiple sources, unify data with different formats into JSON-formatted objects, and route them to different output destinations. Choosing a log collector is important for CPU and memory utilization when you monitor thousands of servers. If you have multiple Amazon EKS clusters, you can use Fluent Bit as a lightweight shipper to collect data from different nodes in the cluster and forward it to Fluentd for aggregation, processing and routing to a supported output destination. We recommend to use Fluent Bit as the log collector and forwarder to send application and cluster logs to CloudWatch. You can then stream the logs to Amazon OpenSearch Service by using a subscription filter in CloudWatch. This option is shown in this section's architecture diagram. Figure: Amazon EKS application logging architecture. The diagram shows the following workflow when application logs from Amazon EKS clusters are streamed to Amazon OpenSearch Service. The Fluent Bit service in the Amazon EKS cluster pushes the logs to CloudWatch. The AWS Lambda function streams the logs to Amazon OpenSearch Service using a subscription filter. You can then use Kibana to visualize the logs in the configured indexes. You can also stream logs by using Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose and store them in an S3 bucket for analysis and querying with Amazon Athena. In most clusters, using Fluentd or Fluent Bit for log aggregation needs little optimization. This changes when you’re dealing with larger clusters with thousands of pods and nodes. We have published our findings from studying the impact of Fluentd and Fluent Bit in clusters with thousands of pods. For further learning, we would recommend you to check on enhancement to Fluent Bit that is designed to reduce the volume API calls it makes to the Kubernetes API servers using Use_Kubelet option. This Fluent Bit’s Use_Kubelet feature allows it to retrieve pod metadata from the kubelet on the host. Amazon EKS customers can use Fluent Bit to capture logs in clusters that run tens of thousands of pods with this feature enabled without overloading the Kubernetes API server. We recommend enabling the feature even if you aren’t running a large Kubernetes cluster. Logging for Amazon EKS on Fargate​ With Amazon EKS on Fargate, you can deploy pods without allocating or managing your Kubernetes nodes. This removes the need to capture system-level logs for your Kubernetes nodes. To capture the logs from your Fargate pods, you can use Fluent Bit to forward the logs directly to CloudWatch. This enables you to automatically route logs to CloudWatch without further configuration or a sidecar container for your Amazon EKS pods on Fargate. For more information about this, see Fargate logging in the Amazon EKS documentation and Fluent Bit for Amazon EKS on the AWS Blog. This solution captures the STDOUT and STDERR input/output (I/O) streams from your container and sends them to CloudWatch through Fluent Bit, based on the Fluent Bit configuration established for the Amazon EKS cluster on Fargate. With Fluent Bit support for Amazon EKS, you no longer need to run a sidecar to route container logs from Amazon EKS pods running on Fargate. With the new built-in logging support, you can select a destination of your choice to send the records to. Amazon EKS on Fargate uses a version of Fluent Bit for AWS, an upstream conformant distribution of Fluent Bit managed by AWS. Figure: Logging for Amazon EKS on Fargate. Please learn more about Fluent Bit support for Amazon EKS see Fargate logging in the Amazon EKS documentation. For some reasons, for pods running on AWS Fargate where you need to use the sidecar pattern. You can run a Fluentd (or Fluent Bit) sidecar container to capture logs produced by your applications. This option requires that the application writes logs to filesystem instead of stdout or stderr. A consequence of this approach is that you will not be able use kubectl logs to view container logs. To make logs appear in kubectl logs, you can write application logs to both stdout and filesystem simultaneously. Pods on Fargate get 20GB of ephemeral storage, which is available to all the containers that belong to a pod. You can configure your application to write logs to the local filesystem and instruct Fluentd to watch the log directory (or file). Fluentd will read events from the tail of log files and send the events to a destination like CloudWatch for storage. Ensure that you rotate logs regularly to prevent logs from usurping the entire volume. Please learn more about How to capture application logs when using Amazon EKS on AWS Fargate to operate and observe your kubernets applications at scale on AWS Fargate. We will also tee write to file and stdout so we see logs in kubectl logs in this approach.","s":"Amazon EKS application logging","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/containers/aws-native/eks/log-aggregation","h":"#amazon-eks-application-logging","p":109},{"i":120,"t":"Customers these days want to unify and centralize logs across different computing platforms such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, and AWS Lambda using agents, log routers, and extensions. We can then use Amazon OpenSearch Service with OpenSearch Dashboards to visualize and analyze the logs, collected across different computing platforms to get application insights. A unified aggregated log system provides the following benefits: A single point of access to all the logs across different computing platforms Help defining and standardizing the transformations of logs before they get delivered to downstream systems like Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon OpenSearch Service, Amazon Redshift, and other services The ability to use Amazon OpenSearch Service to quickly index, and OpenSearch Dashboards to search and visualize logs from its routers, applications, and other devices The following diagram shows the architecture which performs log aggregation across different compute platforms such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS),and AWS Lambda.

Kinesis Data Firehose streams the logs to Amazon OpenSearch Service. Log records that fail to get persisted in Amazon OpenSearch service will get written to AWS S3. To scale this architecture, each of these compute platforms streams the logs to a different Firehose delivery stream, added as a separate index, and rotated every 24 hours.

The configuration shown below enables the ADOT collector to collect Prometheus metrics from services in the cluster using a Prometheus Receiver. The receiver is meant to minimally be a drop-in replacement for Prometheus server. To collect metrics with this receiver, you need a mechanism for discovering the set of target services to be scraped. The receiver supports both static and dynamic discovery of scraping targets using one of the dozens of supported service-discovery mechanisms. As Amazon ECS does not have any built-in service discovery mechanism, the collector relies on Prometheus' support for file-based discovery of targets. To setup the Prometheus receiver for file-based discovery of targets, the collector makes use of the Amazon ECS Observer extension. The extension uses ECS/EC2 API to discover Prometheus scrape targets from all running tasks and filter them based on service names, task definitions and container labels listed under the ecs_observer/task_definitions section in the configuration. All discovered targets are written into the file specified by the result_file field, which resides on the file system mounted to ADOT collector container.

In the central collector pattern, a single instance of ADOT collector is deployed on the cluster and it processes telemetry data from all the tasks running on the cluster. This is the most commonly used deployment pattern. The collector is deployed using either REPLICA or DAEMON service scheduler strategy. The ADOT collector architecture has the concept of a pipeline. A single collector can contain more than one pipeline. Each pipeline is dedicated to processing one of the three types of telemetry data, namely, metrics, traces and logs. You can configure multiple pipelines for each type of telemetry data. This versatile architecture thus allows a single collector to perform the role of multiple observability agents that would otherwise have to be deployed on the cluster. It significantly reduces the deployment footprint of obsevrability agents on the cluster. The primary components of a collector that make up a pipeline are grouped into three categories, namely, Receiver, Processor, and Exporter.

You can choose one of them based on your requirments and specify the configuration file path in the command section of the container defintion. Setting this value to --config=/etc/ecs/container-insights/otel-task-metrics-config.yaml will result in the use of a pipeline configuration that collects resource utilization metrics and traces from other containers running within the same task as the collector and send them to Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray. Specifically, the collector uses an AWS ECS Container Metrics Receiver that reads task metadata and docker stats from Amazon ECS Task Metadata Endpoint, and generates resource usage metrics (such as CPU, memory, network, and disk) from them. { \"family\":\"AdotTask\", \"taskRoleArn\":\"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ECS-ADOT-Task-Role\", \"executionRoleArn\":\"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ECS-Task-Execution-Role\", \"networkMode\":\"awsvpc\", \"containerDefinitions\":[ { \"name\":\"application-container\", \"image\":\"...\" }, { \"name\":\"aws-otel-collector\", \"image\":\"public.ecr.aws/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector:latest\", \"cpu\":512, \"memory\":1024, \"command\": [ \"--config=/etc/ecs/container-insights/otel-task-metrics-config.yaml\" ], \"portMappings\":[ { \"containerPort\":2000, \"protocol\":\"udp\" } ], \"essential\":true } ], \"requiresCompatibilities\":[ \"EC2\" ], \"cpu\":\"1024\", \"memory\":\"2048\" } info Refer to the documentation for details about setting up the IAM task role and task execution role that the ADOT collector will use when deployed on an Amazon ECS cluster. info The AWS ECS Container Metrics Receiver works only for ECS Task Metadata Endpoint V4. Amazon ECS tasks on Fargate that use platform version 1.4.0 or later and Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 that are running at least version 1.39.0 of the Amazon ECS container agent can utilize this receiver. For more information, see Amazon ECS Container Agent Versions As seen in the default pipeline configuration, the collector's pipeline first uses the Filter Processor which filters out a subset of metrics pertaining to CPU, memory, network, and disk usage. Then it uses the Metrics Transform Processor that performs a set of transformations to change the names of these metrics as well as update their attributes. Finally, the metrics are sent to CloudWatch as performance log events using the Amazon CloudWatch EMF Exporter. Using this default configuration will result in collection of the following resource usage metrics under the CloudWatch namespace ECS/ContainerInsights. MemoryUtilized MemoryReserved CpuUtilized CpuReserved NetworkRxBytes NetworkTxBytes StorageReadBytes StorageWriteBytes info Note that these are the same metrics collected by Container Insights for Amazon ECS and are made readily available in CloudWatch when you enable Container Insights at the cluster or account level. Hence, enabling Container Insights is the recommended approach for collecting ECS resource usage metrics in CloudWatch. The AWS ECS Container Metrics Receiver emits 52 unique metrics which it reads from the Amazon ECS Task Metadata Endpoint. The complete list of metrics collected by the receiver is documented here. You may not want to send all of them to your preferred destination. If you want more explicit control over the ECS resource usage metrics, then you can create a custom pipeline configuration, filtering and transforming the available metrics with your choice of processors/transfomers and send them to a destination based on your choice of exporters. Refer to the documentation for additional examples of pipeline configurations to capture ECS task level metrics.

However, this utilization efficiency comes at a tradeoff of increased difficulty measuring application costs. Today, you can use one of these methods to distribute costs by tenant: Hard multi-tenancy — Run separate EKS clusters in dedicated AWS accounts. Soft multi-tenancy — Run multiple node groups in a shared EKS cluster. Consumption based billing — Use resource consumption to calculate the cost incurred in a shared EKS cluster. With Hard multi-tenancy, workloads get deployed in separate EKS clusters and you can identify the cost incurred for the cluster and its dependencies without having to run reports to determine each tenant’s spend. With Soft multi-tenancy, you can use Kubernetes features like Node Selectors and Node Affinity to instruct Kubernetes Scheduler to run a tenant’s workload on dedicated node groups. You can tag the EC2 instances in a node group with an identifier (like product name or team name) and use tags to distribute costs. A downside of the above two approach is that you may end up with unused capacity and may not fully utilize the cost savings that come when you run a densely packed cluster. You still need ways to allocate cost of shared resources like Elastic Load Balancing, network transfer charges. The most efficient way to track costs in multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters is to distribute incurred costs based on the amount of resources consumed by workloads. This pattern allows you to maximize the utilization of your EC2 instances because different workloads can share nodes, which allows you to increase the pod-density on your nodes. However, calculating costs by workload or namespaces is a challenging task. Understanding the cost-responsibility of a workload requires aggregating all the resources consumed or reserved during a time-frame, and evaluating the charges based on the cost of the resource and the duration of the usage. This is the exact challenge that Kubecost is dedicated to tackling. tip Take a look at our One Observability Workshop to get a hands-on experience on Kubecost.","s":"Reasons to use Kubecost","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/cost/kubecost","h":"#reasons-to-use-kubecost","p":248},{"i":254,"t":"The Kubecost Cost Allocation dashboard allows you to quickly see allocated spend and optimization opportunity across all native Kubernetes concepts, e.g. namespace, k8s label, and service.

The default values for these parameters are based on the marginal resource rates of the cloud provider, but they can be customized within Kubecost. These base resource (RAM/CPU/GPU) prices are normalized to ensure the sum of each component is equal to the total price of the node provisioned, based on billing rates from your provider It is the responsibility of each service team to move towards maximum efficiency and fine tune the workloads to achieve the goal.","s":"Efficiency","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/cost/kubecost","h":"#efficiency","p":248},{"i":258,"t":"Cluster idle cost is defined as the difference between the cost of allocated resources and the cost of the hardware they run on.

It provides valuable insights into database performance and helps you identify and resolve issues quickly. Both Amazon RDS and Aurora database sends metrics to CloudWatch for each active database instance at 1 minute granularity. Monitoring is enabled by default and metrics are available for 15 days. RDS and Aurora publish instance-level metrics metrics to Amazon CloudWatch in the AWS/RDS namespace. Using CloudWatch Metrics, you can identify trends or patterns in your database performance, and use this information to optimize your configurations and improve your application's performance. Here are key metricsto monitor : CPU Utilization - Percentage of computer processing capacity used. DB Connections - The number of client sessions that are connected to the DB instance. Consider constraining database connections if you see high numbers of user connections in conjunction with decreases in instance performance and response time. The best number of user connections for your DB instance will vary based on your instance class and the complexity of the operations being performed. To determine the number of database connections, associate your DB instance with a parameter group. Freeable Memory - How much RAM is available on the DB instance, in megabytes. The red line in the Monitoring tab metrics is marked at 75% for CPU, Memory and Storage Metrics. If instance memory consumption frequently crosses that line, then this indicates that you should check your workload or upgrade your instance. Network throughput - The rate of network traffic to and from the DB instance in bytes per second. Read/Write Latency - The average time for a read or write operation in milliseconds. Read/Write IOPS - The average number of disk read or write operations per second. Free Storage Space - How much disk space is not currently being used by the DB instance, in megabytes. Investigate disk space consumption if space used is consistently at or above 85 percent of the total disk space. See if it is possible to delete data from the instance or archive data to a different system to free up space. For troubleshooting performance related issues, first step is to tune the most used and expensive queries. Tune them to see if doing so lowers the pressure on system resources. For more information, see Tuning queries. If your queries are tuned and the issue still persists, consider upgrading your database instance classes. You can upgrade it to an instance with more resources (CPU, RAM, disk space, network bandwidth, I/O capacity). Then, you can set up alarms to alert when these metrics reach critical thresholds, and take action to resolve any issues as quickly as possible. For more information on CloudWatch metrics, refer Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Amazon RDS and Viewing DB instance metrics in the CloudWatch console and AWS CLI. CloudWatch Logs Insights​ CloudWatch Logs Insights enables you to interactively search and analyze your log data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. You can perform queries to help you more efficiently and effectively respond to operational issues. If an issue occurs, you can use CloudWatch Logs Insights to identify potential causes and validate deployed fixes. To publish logs from RDS or Aurora database cluster to CloudWatch, see Publish logs for Amazon RDS or Aurora for MySQL instances to CloudWatch For more information on monitoring RDS or Aurora logs with CloudWatch, see Monitoring Amazon RDS log file. CloudWatch Alarms​ To identify when performance is degraded for your database clusters, you should monitor and alert on key performance metrics on a regular basis. Using Amazon CloudWatch alarms, you can watch a single metric over a time period that you specify. If the metric exceeds a given threshold, a notification is sent to an Amazon SNS topic or AWS Auto Scaling policy. CloudWatch alarms do not invoke actions simply because they are in a particular state. Rather the state must have changed and been maintained for a specified number of periods. Alarms invoke actions only when alarm change state occurs. Being in alarm state is not enough. To set a CloudWatch alarm - Navigate to AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/. In the navigation pane, choose Databases, and then choose a DB instance. Choose Logs & events. In the CloudWatch alarms section, choose Create alarm. For Send notifications, choose Yes, and for Send notifications to, choose New email or SMS topic. For Topic name, enter a name for the notification, and for With these recipients, enter a comma-separated list of email addresses and phone numbers. For Metric, choose the alarm statistic and metric to set. For Threshold, specify whether the metric must be greater than, less than, or equal to the threshold, and specify the threshold value. For Evaluation period, choose the evaluation period for the alarm. For consecutive period(s) of, choose the period during which the threshold must have been reached in order to trigger the alarm. For Name of alarm, enter a name for the alarm. Choose Create Alarm. The alarm appears in the CloudWatch alarms section. Take a look at this example to create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for Multi-AZ DB cluster replica lag. Database Audit Logs​ Database Audit Logs provide a detailed record of all actions taken on your RDS and Aurora databases, enabling you to monitor for unauthorized access, data changes, and other potentially harmful activities. Here are some best practices for using Database Audit Logs: Enable Database Audit Logs for all of your RDS and Aurora instances, and configure them to capture all relevant data. Use a centralized log management solution, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, to collect and analyze your Database Audit Logs. Monitor your Database Audit Logs regularly for suspicious activity, and take action to investigate and resolve any issues as quickly For more information on how to configure database audit logs, see Configuring an Audit Log to Capture database activities for Amazon RDS and Aurora. Database Slow Query and Error Logs​ Slow query logs help you find slow-performing queries in the database so you can investigate the reasons behind the slowness and tune the queries if needed. Error logs help you to find the query errors, which further helps you find the changes in the application due to those errors. You can monitor the slow query log and error log by creating a CloudWatch dashboard using Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights (which enables you to interactively search and analyze your log data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs).

Observability across hybrid and multicloud environments may add significant complexity due to tool diversity, latency, and heterogenous workloads. Regardless, this remains a common goal for both development and business users. A rich ecosystem of products and services address this. However, the usefulness of observability tools for cloud-native workloads can vary dramatically. Consider the different requirements of monitoring a containerized batch processing workload, compared to a real-time banking application using a serverless framework: both have logs, metrics, and traces; however, the toolchain for observing them will vary, with a number of cloud-native, open source, and ISV products available. An open-source tool such as Prometheus may be an excellent fit for one, whereas a cloud-native tool provided as a managed service could better meet your requirements. Add to this the complexity of multicloud and hybrid, and gaining insights from your applications becomes considerably harder. In order to deal with these added dimensions and facilitate approaches to observability, customers tend to invest in a single toolchain with a unified interface. After all, reducing the signal-to-noise ratio is usually a good thing! However, a single approach does not work for all use cases, and the operating models of various platforms may add confusion. Our goal is to help you make informed decisions that compliment your needs and reduce your mean time to remediation when issues do occur. Below are the best practices that we have learned through working with customers of all sizes, and across every industry. tip These best practices are intended for a broad set of roles: enterprise architects, developers, DevOps, and more. We suggest evaluating them through the lens of your organization’s business needs, and how observability in distributed environments can provide as much value as possible.","s":"Intro","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/hybrid-and-multicloud","h":"#intro","p":289},{"i":293,"t":"Your applications, tools, and processes exist to help achieve business outcomes, such as increasing sales and customer satisfaction. A well-advised technology strategy is one that does everything possible to help you achieve those business goals. But the things that help you get there are simply tools, and they are meant to support your strategy – not be the strategy. To make an analogy, if you needed to build a house, you would not ask your tools how to design and build it. Rather, your tools are a means to an end. In a single, homogeneous environment, the decisions around tooling are easier. After all, if you run a single application in one environment, then you tooling can easily be the same across the board. But for hybrid and multicloud environments things are less clear, and keeping an eye on your business outcomes - and the value added by observing your workloads across these environments - is critical. Each Cloud Services Provider (CSP) has their own native observability solutions, and a rich set of partner and Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) whom you can use as well. Just because you operate in multiple environments does not mean that a single tool for every workload is advisable, nor even recommended. This can potentially mean using multiple services, frameworks, or providers, to observe your workloads. See \"a single pane of glass is less important than your workload’s context” below for details of how your operating model needs to reflect your needs. Regardless, when implementing your tools, remember to create “two-way doors” so you can evolve your observability solution in the future. Here are some examples of “tool-first” outcomes to avoid: Focusing on implementation of a single tool without a two-way door to upgrade it, or move to a new solution in the future, may create technical debt that is otherwise avoidable. This can happen when the tool is the solution, and one day may become the problem you need to solve. A company standard to use a single tool due to a volume discount may end-up without features they would benefit from. This may be “cost over quality”, and inadvertently creates a monolithic anti-pattern. This may discourage the collection of telemetry in order to remain under a volume threshold, thereby de-incentivizing the use of observability tooling. Not collecting an entire type of telemetry (usually traces) due to a lack of existing trace collection infrastructure, but a rich set of log and metric collectors, can lead to an incomplete observability solution. Support staff having been trained on only a single toolchain, in the desire to reduce labour and training costs, thereby reducing the potential value of other observability patterns. info If your tooling is dictating your observability strategy, then you need to invert the approach. Tools are meant to enable and empower observability, not to limit your choices. info Tool sprawl is a very real issue that companies struggle with, however a radical shift to a singular toolchain can likewise reduce your observability solution’s usefulness. Hybrid and multicloud workloads have technologies that are unique to each platform, and higher-level services from each CSP are useful – though the trade-offs in using a single-source product require a value-based analysis. See “Invest in OpenTelemetry” for an approach that mitigates some of these risks.","s":"Don’t let your tooling dictate your decisions","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/hybrid-and-multicloud","h":"#dont-let-your-tooling-dictate-your-decisions","p":289},{"i":295,"t":"All data has gravity – which is to say that it attracts workloads, solutions, tools, people, processes, and projects around it. For example, a database with your customer transactions in it will be the attractive force that brings compute and analytics workloads to it. This has direct implications for where you place your workloads, in which environment, and how you operate them going-forward. And the same is true for observability signals, though the gravity this data creates is tied to your workload and organizational context (see \"a single pane of glass is less important than your workload’s context”). One cannot completely separate the context of your observability telemetry from the underlying workload and data that it relates to. The same rule applies here: your telemetry is data, and it has gravity to it. This should influence where you place your telemetry agents, collectors, or systems that aggregate and analyze signals. tip The value of observability data over time is considerably less than most other data types. You could call it the “half-life” of observability data. Consider the additional latency in relaying telemetry to another environment as a potential forced devaluation of this data prior to its potential use, and then weigh that against the requirements you have for alerting when issues occur. info The best practice is to emit data between environments only when there is business value to be gained from this aggregation.

This arises from a natural desire to view as much data as possible, but in as simple a way as can be achieved, and reduce churn, frustration, and diagnosis time. Creating this one interface to see your entire observability solution at once is useful, but can come with the trade-off of separating your telemetry from the context it came from. For example, a dashboard with the CPU utilization of a hundred servers may show some anomalous spikes in consumption, but this does nothing to explain why this has happened, or what the contributing factors are for this behavior. And the importance of this metric may not be immediately clear. We have seen customers sometimes pursue the single pane of glass so aggressively that all business context is lost, and trying to see everything in one tool can actually dilute the value of that data. Your dashboards, and your tools, need to tell a story. And this story needs to include the business metrics and outcomes that are impacted by events in your workloads. Moreover, your tooling needs to align to your operating model. A single pane of glass can add value when your support teams are global with access to all of your environments, but if they are limited to only accessing a single workload, in a single CSP or hybrid environment, then there is no value added through this approach. In these instances, allowing teams to create dashboards within each environment natively may hasten time to value, and be more flexible changes in the future. info The value of observability data is deeply integrated into the application from which it came. Your telemetry requires contextual awareness that comes from its environment. In hybrid and multicloud environments, the differences between technologies makes the need for context even greater (though systems such as Kubernetes can be similar between different cloud providers and on-premises). info When building a single pane of glass for distributed system, display your business metrics and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) in the same view as other data (such as infrastructure metrics) that contributes to these SLOs. This gives context that may otherwise be lacking. tip A single pane of glass can help to rapidly diagnose issues and reduce Time to Detection (MTTD) and thereby Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR), but only if the meaning of telemetry data can be preserved. Without this, a single pane of glass approach can increase the time to value, or become a net-negative for operations teams. info If the value of a single pane of glass cannot be determined, or if workloads are bound entirely to a single CSP or on-premises environment, consider only rolling-up top-level business metrics to a single pane of glass, leaving the raw metrics and other contributing factors in their original environments.","s":"A single pane of glass is less important than your workload’s context","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/hybrid-and-multicloud","h":"#a-single-pane-of-glass-is-less-important-than-your-workloads-context","p":289},{"i":299,"t":"Across the observability vendor landscape, OpenTelemetry (OTel) has become the de-facto standard.

OTel agents and collectors communicate using the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP), which encapsulates signals into a format allowing a wide variety of deployment patterns. To collect transaction traces with the most value, and with your business and infrastructure context, you will need to integrate trace collection into your application. Some auto-instrumentation agents can perform this with almost no effort. However, the most sophisticated use cases do require code changes on your behalf to support transaction traces. This creates some technical debt and ties-down your workload to a particular technology. OTel captures logs, metrics, and traces using a concept of a span. Spans contain these signals grouped together from a single transaction, packaging them into a contextualized, searchable object. This means you can view your signals from a single application event in one simple entity. For example, a user logging into a web site, and the requests this creates to all the downstream services this integrates with, can be presented as a single span. tip OTel is not limited to application traces, and is widely used for logs and metrics. And many ISV products accept OTLP directly today. info By instrumenting your applications using OTel, you remove the need to replace this instrumentation at the application layer in the future, should you choose to move from one observability platform to another.

However, the path to the observability maturity doesn’t always grow along with the workload. The intention is to help customers achieve the required maturity level as they expand and grow their organizational capabilities. The first stage in the observability maturity model typically involves establishing a baseline understanding of the organization's current state. This entails assessing existing monitoring tools and processes, as well as identifying gaps in visibility or functionality. At this stage, organizations can take stock of their current capabilities and set realistic goals for improvement starting even at the early stages of engineering cycle. In the next stage, organizations move towards a more sophisticated approach by adopting advanced observability strategies and services. This may include implementing proactive alerting, distributed tracing to gain insights into the interactions between disparate systems, by which organizations can begin to reap the benefits of increased visibility, reduce cognitive load and more efficient troubleshooting. As businesses progress through the third stage of the observability maturity model, they can leverage additional capabilities such as automated remediation, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to automate anomaly detection and root cause analysis. These advanced features enable organizations to not only detect issues but also take corrective actions before they impact end-users or disrupt business operations. By integrating observability tools with other critical systems such as incident management platforms, organizations can streamline their incident response processes and minimize the time it takes to resolve issues. The final stage of the observability maturity model involves leveraging the wealth of data generated by monitoring and observability tools to drive continuous improvement. This can involve using advanced analytics to identify patterns and trends in workload performance, as well as feeding this information back into engineering and operations processes to optimize resource allocation, architecture, and deployment strategies.","s":"Stages of Observability Maturity Model","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/observability-maturity-model","h":"#stages-of-observability-maturity-model","p":300},{"i":308,"t":"Adopted as the bare minimum and worked in siloes, basic monitoring has an undefined strategy of what is required to monitor the totality of the systems or workloads in an organization. Most of the time, different teams like application owners, Network Operations Center (NOC) or CloudOps or DevOps teams use different tools for their monitoring needs, hence this approach is of little value in terms of debugging across or for optimization of the environment. Typically, customers at this stage have disparate solutions for monitoring their workloads. Different teams, most of the time they gather same data in different ways since there is no or limited partnership with others. The teams tend to optimize what they need by working with the data they obtain. Also, teams cannot use each other’s data since the data obtained from another team could be in a dissimilar format. Creating a plan to identify critical workloads, aiming for a unified solution for observability, defining metrics and logs are key aspects in this level. Designing your workload to capture the essential telemetry it provides is necessary to understand its internal state and the workload health. To build a foundation towards improving the maturity level, instrumenting workloads through collection of metrics, logs, traces and gaining meaningful insights using the right monitoring and observability tools help customers control and optimize the environment. Instrumentation refers to measuring, tracking and capturing key data from environments that can be used to observe the behavior and performance of workloads.

Instead of being reactive and guessing, customers have a workflow that invokes required actions and relevant teams are able to analyze and troubleshoot based on captured information and historical knowledge. Customers in this level work towards accomplishing practices for observability of their environments that could be traditional or modern, highly scalable, distributed, agile and microservices architecture. Although monitoring seems to be working well in most cases, organizations tend to spend more time debugging issues and as a result the overall Mean Time-To-Resolution (MTTR) is not consistent or meaningfully improved over a period of time. Also, there is higher than expected cognitive time and effort to debug issues hence longer incident response. There tends to be a data overload situation that overwhelms operations as well. We find most enterprises being caught in this stage without realizing where they could go next. Specific actions that can be taken to move the organization to the next level are: 1) Review your systems’ architecture designs at regular intervals and deploy policies and practices to reduce the impact and downtime leading to fewer alerts. 2) Prevent alert fatigue by defining actionable KPIs, add valuable context to the alert findings, categorizing by severity/urgency, sending to different tools and teams to help engineers resolve the issues faster.

When an issue arises, alerts provide enough contextual information to relevant teams like Network Operations Center (NOC) or CloudOps or DevOps teams. The monitoring team are able to look at an alert and immediately determine the root cause of the issue through correlation of signals like metrics, logs as well as traces. Traces are data collected from your application about requests that can be used with tools to view, filter, and gain insights to identify issues and opportunities for optimization. Traced requests of your application provides detailed information not only about the request and response, but also about calls that your application makes to downstream AWS resources, microservices, databases, and web APIs. They can look at a trace, find the corresponding log events as traces are captured and also look at metrics from the infrastructure and applications obtaining a 360° view of the situation, they are in. Appropriate teams can take remedial actions at once by providing a fix that solves the issue. In this scenario, the MTTR is very small, the Service Level Objectives (SLO) are green, and the burn rate through the error budget is tolerable. Typically, customers in this level have accomplished practices for observability of their modern, agile, highly scalable and microservices environments. There are many organizations that have achieved this level of sophistication and maturity in their observability environments. This stage already gives organizations the ability to support complex infrastructure, operate their systems with high availability, provide higher Service Level Availability (SLA) for their applications and achieve business innovation by providing reliable infrastructure. Customers also use anomaly detectors to monitor anomalies & outliers which do not match usual patterns and have near real time alerting mechanisms. However, teams in such organizations always want to go beyond the art of the possible. Teams would like to understand repeated issues, create a knowledge base that they can make use of to model against scenarios in order to predict issues that might arise in the future. That is when customers move to the next stage of the maturity model, in which they get insights into the unknown. In order to get there, new tools are needed and also new skills and techniques in storing and making use of the data needs to be identified. One can make use of Artificial intelligence for IT operations (AIOps) to create systems that automatically correlate signals, identify root cause, create resolution plans based on models trained using data collected in the past.","s":"Stage 3: Advanced Observability - Correlation and Anomaly Detection","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/observability-maturity-model","h":"#stage-3-advanced-observability---correlation-and-anomaly-detection","p":300},{"i":314,"t":"Here Observability data is not only used “after” an issue occurs, rather makes use of the data in real-time “before” an issue occurs.

Observability software vendors are continuously expanding their capabilities into this space and this has only accelerated with Generative AI becoming popular, so that organizations aspiring to achieve such maturity level can accomplish with ease. Once this stage matures and takes shape, customers see a situation where the observability services are able to automatically create dynamic dashboards. The dashboards can only contain information that is relevant to the issue on hand. This will save time and cost in querying and visualizing data that don’t really matter.

AWS Well-Architected and Cloud Adoption Framework for observability provides a structured approach for designing, deploying, and operating workloads, ensuring best practices are followed. This leads to improved availability, system performance, scalability and reliability. These frameworks also provide organizations with a standardized set of practices and prescriptive guidance, making it easier to collaborate, share knowledge and implement consistent solutions across the organization. To effectively leverage, organizations need to understand the key components called the pillars (operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization and sustainability) of AWS Well-Architected framework, which provide a holistic approach for designing and operating cloud environment. On the other hand, the Cloud Adoption Framework provides a structured approach to cloud adoption, focusing on areas such as business, people, governance, and platform. By aligning these components with observability requirements, organizations can build robust and scalable workloads. Implementing AWS Well-Architected and Cloud Adoption Frameworks for observability involves a few steps. Firstly, organizations need to assess their current state and identify areas for improvement. This can be done by conducting an Observability Maturity Model assessment, which evaluates the workloads against these frameworks. Based on the review findings, organizations can prioritize and plan their observability initiatives. This includes defining monitoring and logging requirements, selecting appropriate AWS services, and implementing the necessary infrastructure and tools. Lastly, organizations need to continuously monitor and optimize their observability solutions to ensure ongoing effectiveness. Also, customers can utilize AWS Well-Architected Tool which is a service in AWS to document and measure their workload using the best practices of AWS Well-Architected Framework.

Organizations want to ensure that their customers have a great customer experience, so they start with those customer requirements and work backwards from there. Then work with your stakeholders because they understand those requirements really well. With the aim for an observability strategy, organizations must first define their observability goals as they should be aligned with the overall business objectives and should clearly articulate what the organization aims to achieve through the strategy, providing a roadmap for building and implementing the observability plan. Next, organizations need to identify key metrics (KPIs) that will provide insights into system performance. These could range from latency and error rates to resource utilization and transaction volumes. It is important to note that the choice of metrics will largely depend on the nature of the business and its specific needs. Once the key metrics have been identified, organizations can then decide on the tools and technologies required for data collection. The choice of tool should be based on its alignment with the organization's goals, its ease of integration with existing systems, optimize cost, achieve scalability, meet customer needs and improve the overall customer experience. Finally, organizations should also encourage a culture that values observability. This involves training team members on the importance of observability, encouraging them to proactively monitor system performance, and fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement. This strategy creates virtuous cycle of continuous process of collection, action and improvement for the best possible customer experience. In summary, to build an observability strategy the three main aspects need to be considered: 1) what needs be collected 2) what are all the systems and workloads that need to be observed and 3/ how to react when there are issues and what mechanisms should be in place to remediate them.","s":"Building the observability strategy","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/observability-maturity-model","h":"#building-the-observability-strategy","p":300},{"i":322,"t":"The observability maturity model serves as a roadmap for organizations to assess their current state and seeking ways to improve their ability to understand, analyze, and respond to the behavior of workloads and infrastructure.

We strongly encourage you to take a look at the section in the upstream documentation for more specifics as there isn't any AWS specific aspect that changes the guidance for this approach.","s":"No Collector","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/operational/adot-at-scale/operating-adot-collector","h":"#no-collector","p":351},{"i":358,"t":"In this approach, you will run the collector in a distributed manner and collect signals into the destinations. Unlike the No Collector option, here we separate the concerns and decouple the application from having to use its resources to make remote API calls and instead communicate to a locally accessible agent. Essentially it will look like this below in an Amazon EKS environment running the collector as a Kubernetes sidecar: In this above architecture, your scrape configuration shouldn't really have to make use of any service discovery mechanisms at all since you will be scraping the targets from localhost given that the collector is running in the same pod as the application container. The same architecture applies to collecting traces as well. You will simply have to create a OTEL pipeline as shown here Pros and Cons​ One argument advocating for this design is that you don't have to allocate extra-ordinary amount of resources (CPU, Memory) for the Collector to do its job since the targets are limited to localhost sources. The disadvantage of using this approach could be that, the number of varied configurations for the collector pod configuration is directly proportional to the number of applications you are running on the cluster. This means, you will have to manage CPU, Memory and other resource allocation individually for each Pod depending on the workload that is expected for the Pod. By not being careful with this, you might over or under-allocate resources for the Collector Pod that will result in either under-performing or locking up CPU cycles and Memory which could otherwise be used by other Pods in the Node. You could also deploy the collector in other models such as Deployments, Daemonset, Statefulset etc based on your needs. Running the collector as a Daemonset on Amazon EKS​ You can choose to run the collector as a Daemonset in case you want to evenly distribute the load (scraping and sending the metrics to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace) of the collectors across the EKS Nodes. Ensure you have the keep action that makes the collector only scrape targets from its own host/Node. See sample below for reference. Find more such configuration details here. scrape_configs: - job_name: kubernetes-apiservers bearer_token_file: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token kubernetes_sd_configs: - role: endpoints relabel_configs: - action: keep regex: $K8S_NODE_NAME source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_endpoint_node_name] scheme: https tls_config: ca_file: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt insecure_skip_verify: true The same architecture can also be used for collecting traces. In this case, instead of the Collector reaching out to the endpoints to scrape Prometheus metrics, the trace spans will be sent to the Collector by the application pods. Pros and Cons​ Advantages Minimal scaling concerns Configuring High-Availability is a challenge Too many copies of Collector in use Can be easy for Logs support Disadvantages Not the most optimal in terms of resource utilization Disproportionate resource allocation Running the collector on Amazon EC2​ As there is no side car approach in running the collector on EC2, you would be running the collector as an agent on the EC2 instance. You can set a static scrape configuration such as the one below to discover targets in the instance to scrape metrics from. The config below scrapes endpoints at ports 9090 and 8081 on localhost. Get a hands-on deep dive experience in this topic by going through our EC2 focused module in the One Observability Workshop. global: scrape_interval: 15s # By default, scrape targets every 15 seconds. scrape_configs: - job_name: 'prometheus' static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9090', 'localhost:8081'] Running the collector as Deployment on Amazon EKS​ Running the collector as a Deployment is particularly useful when you want to also provide High Availability for your collectors. Depending on the number of targets, metrics available to scrape etc the resources for the Collector should be adjusted to ensure the collector isn't starving and hence causing issues in signal collection. Read more about this topic in the guide here. The following architecture shows how a collector is deployed in a separate node outside of the workload nodes to collect metrics and traces. To setup High-Availability for metric collection, read our docs that provide detailed instructions on how you can set that up Running the collector as a central task on Amazon ECS for metrics collection​ You can use the ECS Observer extension to collect Prometheus metrics across different tasks in an ECS cluster or across clusters. Sample collector configuration for the extension: extensions: ecs_observer: refresh_interval: 60s # format is https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration cluster_name: 'Cluster-1' # cluster name need manual config cluster_region: 'us-west-2' # region can be configured directly or use AWS_REGION env var result_file: '/etc/ecs_sd_targets.yaml' # the directory for file must already exists services: - name_pattern: '^retail-.*$' docker_labels: - port_label: 'ECS_PROMETHEUS_EXPORTER_PORT' task_definitions: - job_name: 'task_def_1' metrics_path: '/metrics' metrics_ports: - 9113 - 9090 arn_pattern: '.*:task-definition/nginx:[0-9]+' Pros and Cons​ An advantage in this model is that there are fewer collectors and configurations to manage yourself. When the cluster is rather large and there are thousands of targets to scrape, you will have to carefully design the architecture in such a way that the load is balanced across the collectors. Adding this to having to run near-clones of the same collectors for HA reasons should be done carefully in order to avoid operational issues.","s":"Agent","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/operational/adot-at-scale/operating-adot-collector","h":"#agent","p":351},{"i":361,"t":"The OTEL Collector exposes several signals for us to keep tab of its health and performance.

This metric is one to watch out to understand if the collector is having issues in sending trace data to the destination configured. In this case, you can see that the exporter label with value awsxray indicating the trace destination in use. The other metric otelcol_process_runtime_total_sys_memory_bytes is an indicator to understand the amount of memory being used by the collector. If this memory goes too close to the value in otelcol_process_memory_rss metric, that is an indication that the Collector is getting close to exhausting the allocated memory for the process and it might be time for you to take action such as allocating more memory for the collector to avoid issues. Likewise, you can see that there is another counter metric called otelcol_exporter_enqueue_failed_metric_points that indicates the number of metrics that failed to be sent to the remote destination Collector health check​ There is a liveness probe that the collector exposes in-order for you to check whether the collector is live or not. It is recommended to use that endpoint to periodically check the collector's availability. The healthcheck extension can be used to have the collector expose the endpoint. See sample configuration below: extensions: health_check: endpoint: 0.0.0.0:13133 For the complete configuration options, refer to the GitHub repo here. ❯ curl -v http://localhost:13133 * Trying 127.0.0.1:13133... * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 13133 (#0) > GET / HTTP/1.1 > Host: localhost:13133 > User-Agent: curl/7.79.1 > Accept: */* > * Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse < HTTP/1.1 200 OK < Date: Fri, 24 Feb 2023 19:09:22 GMT < Content-Length: 0 < * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact Setting limits to prevent catastrophic failures​ Given that resources (CPU, Memory) are finite in any environment, you should set limits to the collector components in-order to avoid failures due to unforeseen situations. It is particularly important when you are operating the ADOT Collector to collect Prometheus metrics. Take this scenario - You are in the DevOps team and are responsible for deploying and operating the ADOT Collector in an Amazon EKS cluster. Your application teams can simply drop their application Pods at will anytime of the day, and they expect the metrics exposed from their pods to be collected into an Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace. Now it is your responsibility to ensure that this pipeline works without any hiccups. There are two ways to solve this problem at a high level: Scaling the collector infinitely (hence adding Nodes to the cluster if needed) to support this requirement Set limits on metric collection and advertise the upper threshold to the application teams There are pros and cons to both approaches. You can argue that you want to choose option 1, if you are fully committed to supporting your ever growing business needs not considering the costs or the overhead that it might bring in. While supporting the ever growing business needs infinitely might sound like cloud is for infinite scalability point of view, this can bring in a lot of operational overhead and might lead into much more catastrophical situations if not given infinite amount of time, and people resources to ensure continual uninterrupted operations, which in most cases is not practical. A much more pragmatic and frugal approach would be to choose option 2, where you are setting upper limits (and potentially increasing gradually based on needs progressively) at any given time to ensure the operational boundary is obvious. Here is an example of how you can do that with using Prometheus receiver in the ADOT Collector. In Prometheus scrape_config, you can set several limits for any particular scrape job. You could put limits on, The total body size of the scrape Limit number of labels to accept (the scrape will be discarded if this limit exceeds and you can see that in the Collector logs) Limit the number of targets to scrape ..more You can see all available options in the Prometheus documentation. Limiting Memory usage​ The Collector pipeline can be configured to use memorylimiterprocessor to limit the amount of memory the processor component will use. It is common to see customers wanting the Collector to do complex operations that require intense Memory and CPU requirements. While using processors such as redactionprocessor,filterprocessor,spanprocessor, are exciting and very useful, you should also remember that processors in general deal with data transformation tasks and it requires them to keep data in-memory in-order to complete the tasks. This can lead to a specific processor breaking the Collector entirely and also the Collector not having enough memory to expose its own health metrics. You can avoid this by limiting the amount of memory the Collector can use by making use of the memorylimiterprocessor.. The recommendation for this is to provide buffer memory for the Collector to make use of for exposing health metrics and perform other tasks so the processors do not take all the allocated memory. For example, if your EKS Pod has a memory limit of 10Gi, then set the memorylimitprocessor to less than 10Gi, for example 9Gi so the buffer of 1Gi can be used to perform other operations such as exposing health metrics, receiver and exporter tasks. Backpressure management​ Some architecture patterns (Gateway pattern) such as the one shown below can be used to centralize some operational tasks such as (but not limited to) filtering out sensitive data out of signal data to maintain compliance requirements. However, it is possible to overwhelm the Gateway Collector with too many such processing tasks that can cause issues. The recommended approach would be is to distribute the process/memory intense tasks between the individual collectors and the gateway so the workload is shared. For example, you could use the resourceprocessor to process resource attributes and use the transformprocessor to transform the signal data from within the individual Collectors as soon as the signal collection happens. Then you could use the filterprocessor to filter out certain parts of the signal data and use the redactionprocessor to redact sensitive information such as Credit Card numbers etc. The high-level architecture diagram would look like the one below: As you might have observed already, the Gateway Collector can soon become a single point of failure. One obvious choice there is to spin up more than one Gateway Collector and proxy requests through a load balancer like AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) as shown below. Handling out-of-order samples in Prometheus metric collection​ Consider the following scenario in the architecture below: Assume that metrics from ADOT Collector-1 in the Amazon EKS Cluster are sent to the Gateway cluster, which is being directed to the Gateway ADOT Collector-1 In a moment, the metrics from the same ADOT Collector-1 (which is collecting the same targets, hence the same metric samples are being dealt with) is being sent to Gateway ADOT Collector-2 Now if the Gateway ADOT Collector-2 happens to dispatch the metrics to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace first and then followed by the Gateway ADOT Collector-1 which contains older samples for the same metrics series, you will receive the out of order sample error from Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. See example error below: Error message: 2023-03-02T21:18:54.447Z error exporterhelper/queued_retry.go:394 Exporting failed. The error is not retryable.

Refer to the link here for additional details. As an alternate option, you can add an external label in the Gateway Collectors to distinguish the metric series so Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus considers these metrics are individual metric series and are not from the same. warning Using this solution can will result in multiplying the metric series in proportion to the Gateway Collectors in the setup. This is might mean that you can overrun some limits such as Active time series limits If you are deploying ADOT Collector as a Daemonset: make sure you are using relabel_configs to only keep samples from the same node where each ADOT Collector pod is running.

Open Agent Management Protocol (OpAMP)​ OpAMP is a client/server protocol that supports communication over HTTP and over WebSockets. OpAMP is implemented in the OTel Collector and hence the OTel Collector can be used as a server as part of the control plane to manage other agents that support OpAMP, like the OTel Collector itself. The \"manage\" portion here involves being able to update configurations for collectors, monitoring health or even upgrading the Collectors. The details of this protocol is well documented in the upstream OpenTelemetry website.","s":"Collecting health metrics from the Collector","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/operational/adot-at-scale/operating-adot-collector","h":"#collecting-health-metrics-from-the-collector","p":351},{"i":365,"t":"It may become necessary to horizontally scale an ADOT Collector depending on your workload. The requirement to horizontally scale is entirely dependent on your use case, Collector configuration, and telemetry throughput. Platform specific horizontal scaling techniques can be applied to a Collector as you would any other application while being cognizant of stateful, stateless, and scraper Collector components. Most collector components are stateless, meaning that they do not hold state in memory, and if they do it is not relevant for scaling purposes. Additional replicas of stateless Collectors can be scaled behind an application load balancer. Stateful Collector components are collector components that retain information in memory which is crucial for the operation of that component. Examples of stateful components in the ADOT Collector include but are not limited to: Tail Sampling Processor - requires all spans for a trace to make an accurate sampling decisions. Avanced sampling scaling techniques is documented on the ADOT developer portal. AWS EMF Exporter - performs cummulative to delta conversions on some metric types. This conversion requires the previous metric value to be stored in memory. Cummulative to Delta Processor - cummulative to delta conversion requires storing the previous metric value in memory. Collector components that are scrapers actively obtain telemetry data rather than passively receive it. Currently, the Prometheus receiver is the only scraper type component in the ADOT Collector. Horizontally scaling a collector configuration that contains a prometheus receiver will require splitting the scraping jobs per collector to ensure that no two Collectors scrape the same endpoint.

A 2017 study showed that more than half (53%) of mobile users abandon a page if it takes more than 3 seconds to load. There are of course, many studies that show the importance of page speed, and it is an obvious metric to measure, but you need to measure it and take action because it has a measureable impact on conversion and you can use that data to make improvements.","s":"Where do I start?","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/operational/business/monitoring-for-business-outcomes","h":"#where-do-i-start","p":366},{"i":373,"t":"You cannot be expected to know everything that you customers care about. If you are reading this, you are probably in a technical role. You need to talk to the stakeholders in your organisation, this isn't always easy, but it is vital to ensuring that you are measuring what's important. Let's continue with the e-commerce example. This time, consider search: it may be obvious that customers need to be able to search for a product in order to buy it, but did you know that according to a Forrester Research report, 43% of visitors navigate immediately to the search box and searches are 2-3 times more likely to convert compared to non-searchers. Search is really important, it has to work well and you need to monitor it - maybe you discover that particular searches are yeilding no results and that you need to move from naive pattern matching to natural language processing. This is an example of monitoring for a business outcome and then acting to improve the customer experience. At Amazon: We strive to deeply understand customers and work backwards from their pain points to rapidly develop innovations that create meaningful solutions in their lives. — Daniel Slater - Worldwide Lead, Culture of Innovation, AWS in Elements of Amazon’s Day 1 Culture We start with the customer and work backwards from their needs. This isn't the only approach to success in business, but it is a good approach to observability. Work with stakeholders to understand what's important to your customers and then work backwards from there. As an added benefit, if you collect metrics that are important to your customers and stakeholders, you can visualize these in near real-time dashboards and avoid having to create reports or answer questions such as \"how long is it taking to load the landing page?\" or \"how much is it costing to run the website?\" - stakeholders and executives should be able to self serve this information. These are the kind of high level metrics that really matter for your application and they are also almost always the best indicator that there is an issue. For example: an alert indicating that there are fewer orders than you would normally expect in a given time period tells you that there is probably an issue that is impacting customers; an alert indicating that a volume on a server is nearly full or that you have a high number of 5xx errors for a particular service may be something that requires fixing, but you still have to understand customer impact and then prioritize accordingly - this can take time. Issues that impact customers are easy to identify when you are measuring these high level business metrics. These metrics are the what is happening. Other metrics and other forms of observability such as tracing and logs are the why is this happening, which will lead you to what you can do to fix it or improve it.","s":"Working backwards","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/operational/business/monitoring-for-business-outcomes","h":"#working-backwards","p":366},{"i":375,"t":"Now you have an idea of what matters to your customers, you can identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

As was discussed earlier, the number of 5xx errors, does not indicate impact, but it could have an effect on your KPIs. Work your way backwards from what will impact business outcomes to things that may impact business outcomes. Once you know what you need to collect, you need to identify the sources of information that will provide you with the metrics you can use to measure KPIs and related metrics that may impact those KPIs. This is the basis of what you observe. This data is likely to come from Metrics, Logs and Traces. Once you have this data, you can use it to alert when outcomes are at risk. You can then evaluate the impact and attempt to rectify the issue. Almost always, this data will tell you that there’s a problem, before an isolated technical metric (such as cpu or memory) does. You can use observability reactively to fix an issue impacting business outcomes or you can use the data proactively to do something like improve your customer's search experience.","s":"What to observe","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/operational/business/monitoring-for-business-outcomes","h":"#what-to-observe","p":366},{"i":377,"t":"Whilst CPU, RAM, Disk Space and other technical metrics are important for scaling, performance, capacity and cost – they don’t really tell you how your application is doing and don’t give any insight in to customer experience.

Uptime could allow a small percentage of faults over a 5 min window). Build an effective tagging strategy with purpose built schema that aligns to various business functional outcomes. This should especially cover operational observability and incident management. Where possible leverage dynamic thresholds for alarms (esp. for metrics that do not have baseline KPIs) using CloudWatch anomaly detection which provides machine learning algorithms to establish the baselines. When utilizing AWS available services that publish CW metrics (or other sources like prometheus metrics) to configure alarms consider creating composite alarms to reduce alarm noise.

An average can sometimes hide important information, such as outliers or variations in the data, that can significantly impact performance and user experience. Percentiles, on the other hand, can reveal these hidden details and give a better understanding of how the data is distributed. In Amazon CloudWatch, percentiles can be used to monitor and report on various metrics, such as response times, latency, and error rates, across your applications and infrastructure. By setting up alarms on percentiles, you can get alerted when specific percentile values exceed thresholds, allowing you to take action before they impact more customers. To use percentiles in CloudWatch, choose your metric in All metrics in the CloudWatch console and use an existing metric and set the statistic to p99, you can then edit the value after the p to whichever percentile you would like. You can then view percentile graphs, add them to CloudWatch dashboards and set alarms on these metrics. For example, you could set an alarm to notify you when the 95th percentile of response times exceeds a certain threshold, indicating that a significant percentage of users are experiencing slow response times. The histogram below was created in Amazon Managed Grafana using a CloudWath Logs Insights query from CloudWatch RUM logs. The query used was: fields @timestamp, event_details.duration | filter event_type = \"com.amazon.rum.performance_navigation_event\" | sort @timestamp desc The histogram plots the page load time in milliseconds. With this view, it's possible to clearly see the outliers. This data is hidden if average is used. The same data shown in CloudWatch using the average value indicates that pages are taking under two seconds to load. You can see from the histogram above, that most pages are actually taking less than a second and we have outliers. Using the same data again with a percentile (p99) indicates that there is an issue, the CloudWatch graph now shows that 99 percent of page loads are taking less than 23 seconds. To make this easier to visualize, the graphs below compare the average value to the 99th percentile. In this case, the target page load time is two seconds, it is possible to use alternative CloudWatch statistics and metric math to make other calculations. In this case Percentile rank (PR) is used with the statistic PR(:2000) to show that 92.7% of page loads are happening within the target of 2000ms. Using percentiles in CloudWatch can help you gain deeper insights into your system's performance, detect issues early, and improve your customer's experience by identifying outliers that would otherwise be hidden.","s":"Percentiles are important","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/operational/business/sla-percentile","h":"","p":403},{"i":406,"t":"This article describes an approach for manually instrumenting Spring-Integration applications utilizing Open Telemetry and X-ray.

Given that one of the main benefits of tracing is end-to-end visibility of a request, it is important for traces to link properly all the way from the request origin to the backend. A common way of doing this in OpenTelemetry is to utilize nested spans.

Here is an overview of what is necessary to achieve this: Create a ChannelInterceptor and register it as a GlobalChannelInterceptor so that it can capture messages being sent across all channels. In the ChannelInterceptor: In the preSend method: try to read the context from the previous message that is being generated upstream.This is where we are able to connect spans from upstream messages.

You can’t use custom dashboards to track SLO (Service Level Objectives) and SLI (Service Level Indicators) related to data-correctness, data-freshness, or end-to-end latency, and then visualize them with ganglia. Amazon CloudWatch is a critical tool for monitoring and managing your Databricks clusters on AWS.

We can use Grafana to visualize data from several sources, such as Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, Amazon CloudWatch, and many others. It will be used to visualize Databricks metrics and alerts. AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry is the AWS-supported distribution of OpenTelemetry project, which provides open source standards, libraries, and services for collecting traces and metrics.

AWS Open Source services for observability will allow operations teams to use the same existing infrastructure, the same query language, and existing dashboards and alerts to monitor Databricks workloads, without the heavy lifting of managing these services infrastructure, scalability, and performance. ADOT is the best alternative for teams that need to send metrics and traces to different destinations, such as CloudWatch and Prometheus, or work with different types of data sources, such as OTLP and StatsD. Finally, Amazon Managed Grafana supports many different Data Sources, including CloudWatch and Prometheus, and help correlate data for teams that decide on using more than one tool, allowing for the creation of templates that will enable observability for all Databricks Clusters, and a powerful API that allow its provisioning and configuration through Infrastructure as Code. Figure 3: Databricks Open Source Observability Architecture To observe metrics from a Databricks cluster using AWS Managed Open Source Services for Observability, you will need an Amazon Managed Grafana workspace for visualizing both metrics and alerts, and an Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace, configured as a datasource in the Amazon Managed Grafana workspace. There are two important kind of metrics that must be collected: Spark and node metrics. Spark metrics will bring information such as current number of workers in the cluster, or executors; shuffles, that happen when nodes exchenge data during processing; or spills, when data go from RAM to disk and from disk to RAM. To expose these metrics, Spark native Prometheus - available since version 3.0 - must be enabled through Databricks management console, and configured through a init_script. To keep track of node metrics, such as disk usage, CPU time, memory, storage performance, we use the node_exporter, that can be used without any further configuration, but should only expose important metrics. An ADOT Collector must be installed in each node of the cluster, scraping the metrics exposed by both Spark and the node_exporter, filtering these metrics, injecting metadata such as cluster_name, and sending these metrics to the Prometheus workspace. Both the ADOT Collector and the node _exporter must be installed and configured through a init_script.

Finally we have a few libraries like 'serde' and 'time' to handle some of the data creation that we use to populate our sdk calls.

By using PutMetricData we are writing the time-series value of the metric directly to CloudWatch. This is the most efficient way of adding the value. When we use PutMetricData we need to provide the namespace, as well as any dimensions to each AWS SDK call along side the metric value. Here is the code: First we will set up a function that takes in our metric (diceroll value) and it returns a Result type, which in Rust indicates success of failure. The first thing we do within the function is initialize our AWS Rust SDK client. Our client will inherit credentials and region from the local environment. So make sure those are configured by running aws configure from your command line prior to running this code. async fn put_metric_data(roll_value: i32) -> Result<(), cloudwatch::Error> { //Create a reusable aws config that we can pass to our clients let config = aws_config::load_defaults(BehaviorVersion::v2023_11_09()).await; //Create a cloudwatch client let client = cloudwatch::Client::new(&config); After initializing our client we can start to setup the input needed for our PutMetricData API call. We need to define the dimensions and then the MetricDatum itself, which is the combination of dimensions and value. //Use fluent builders to build the required input for pmd call, starting with dimensions. let dimensions = Dimension::builder() .name(\"roll_value_pmd_dimension\") .value(roll_value.to_string()) .build(); let put_metric_data_input = MetricDatum::builder() .metric_name(\"roll_value_pmd\") .dimensions(dimensions) .value(f64::from(roll_value)) .build(); Finally we can make the PutMetricData API call using the input we defined previously. let response = client .put_metric_data() .namespace(\"rust_custom_metrics\") .metric_data(put_metric_data_input) .send() .await?; println!(\"Metric Submitted: {:?}\", response); Ok(()) Notice that the sdk call is in an async function. Since the function completes asynchronously, we need to await it's completion. Then we return the Result type as defined in the top level of our function. When it's time to call our function from main it will just look like this: //call the put_metric_data function with the roll value println!(\"First we will write a custom metric with PutMetricData API call\"); put_metric_data(roll_value).await.unwrap(); Again we are awaiting the function call to complete and then we unwrap the value as in our case we are only interested in the 'Ok' result and not the error.

Once the metric is in a CloudWatch log group we can use a Metric Filter to extract the metric data from the log data. First we will define a struct for our log messages. This is optional, as we could just manually build a json. But in a more complex application you would likely want this logging struct for re-usability. //Make a simple struct for the log message. We could also just create a json string manually. #[derive(Serialize)] struct DicerollValue { welcome_message: String, roll_value: i32, } Once our struct is defined we are ready to make our AWS API call. Again we will create an API client, this time using the logs sdk. We will also define the system time using unix epoch timing. //Create a reusable aws config that we can pass to our clients let config = aws_config::load_defaults(BehaviorVersion::v2023_11_09()).await; //Create a cloudwatch logs client let client = cloudwatchlogs::Client::new(&config); //Let's get the time in ms from unix epoch, this is required for CWlogs let time_now = SystemTime::now() .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH) .unwrap() .as_millis() as i64; First we will create json from a new instantiation of our struct we defined earlier. Then use this to create a log event. let log_json = json!(DicerollValue { welcome_message: String::from(\"Hello from rust!\"), roll_value }); let log_event = InputLogEvent::builder() .timestamp(time_now) .message(log_json.to_string()) .build(); Now we can complete our API call in a similar way to what we did with PutMetricData let response = client .put_log_events() .log_group_name(\"rust_custom\") .log_stream_name(\"diceroll_log_stream\") .log_events(log_event.unwrap()) .send() .await?; println!(\"Log event submitted: {:?}\", response); Ok(()) Once the log event has been submitted, we need to go to CloudWatch and create a Metric Filter for the log group to properly extract the metric. In the CloudWatch console go to the rust_custom log group that we created. Then create a metric filter. The filter pattern should be {$.roll_value = *} . Then for the Metric Value use $.roll_value . You can use any namespace and metric name that you like. This Metric Filter can be explained like so: \"Trigger the filter whenever we get a field called 'roll_value', no matter what the value is. Once triggered, use the 'roll_value' as the number to write to CloudWatch Metrics\". This way of creating metrics is very powerful for extracting time series values from log-data when you do not have control over the log formatting. Since we are directly instrumenting code, we do have control over the format of our log data, therefore a better method may be to use CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format, which we will discuss in the next step.","s":"PutLogEvent + Metric Filter","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/rust-custom-metrics/","h":"#putlogevent--metric-filter","p":467},{"i":485,"t":"CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format(EMF) is a way of embedding time series metrics directly in your logs. CloudWatch will then extract the metrics without the need for Metric Filters. Let's take a look at the code.

This needs to have all the data required for CloudWatch to create the custom metric, so we embed the namespace, dimensions, and value in the string. //Create a json string in embedded metric format with our diceroll value. let json_emf = json!( { \"_aws\": { \"Timestamp\": time_now, \"CloudWatchMetrics\": [ { \"Namespace\": \"rust_custom_metrics\", \"Dimensions\": [[\"roll_value_emf_dimension\"]], \"Metrics\": [ { \"Name\": \"roll_value_emf\" } ] } ] }, \"roll_value_emf_dimension\": roll_value.to_string(), \"roll_value_emf\": roll_value } ); Notice how we actually create a dimension out of our roll value as well as using it for the value. This let's us perform a GroupBy on the roll value so we can see how many times each roll value was landed on. Now we can make the API call to write the log event just like we did before: let log_event = InputLogEvent::builder() .timestamp(time_now) .message(json_emf.to_string()) .build(); let response = client .put_log_events() .log_group_name(\"rust_custom\") .log_stream_name(\"diceroll_log_stream_emf\") .log_events(log_event.unwrap()) .send() .await?; println!(\"EMF Log event submitted: {:?}\", response); Ok(()) Once the log event is submitted to CloudWatch, the metric will be extracted without any need for a metric filter.

AWS's managed OpenTelemetry Lambda Layer utilizes OpenTelemetry Lambda Layer to export telemetry data asynchronously from AWS Lambda. It provides plug-and-play user experience by wrapping an AWS Lambda function, and by packaging the OpenTelemetry runtime specific SDK, trimmed down version of ADOT collector together with an out-of-the-box configuration for auto-instrumenting AWS Lambda functions.

Find the complete list here. ADOT also supports integrations with partner solutions. ADOT Lambda Layer supports both auto-instrumentation (for Python, NodeJS, and Java) as well as custom instrumentation for any specific set of libraries and SDKs.

For EKS Fargate, the ADOT Collector uses a Prometheus Receiver to scrape metrics from the Kubernetes API server, which acts as a proxy for the kubelet on worker nodes. This approach is necessary due to the networking limitations in EKS Fargate that prevent direct access to the kubelet.

In this guide, we will learn essential concepts, tools and best practices to implement Observability of your Lambda based serverless application. The first step before you implement observability for your infrastructure or application is to determine your key objectives. It could be enhanced user experience, increased developer productivity, meeting service level objectives (SLOs), increasing business revenue or any other specific objective depending on your application type.

These are difficult to parse and analyze programmatically at scale, particularly in a AWS Lambda based applications that can generate many lines of log messages across different log groups. As a result, consolidating these logs in CloudWatch becomes challenging and hard to analyze. You would need to do text match or regular expressions to find relevant information in the logs. Here’s is an example of what unstructured logging looks like: [2023-07-19T19:59:07Z] INFO Request started [2023-07-19T19:59:07Z] INFO AccessDenied: Could not access resource [2023-07-19T19:59:08Z] INFO Request finished As you can see, the log messages lack a consistent structure, making it challenging to get useful insights from it. Also, it is hard to add contextual information to it. Whereas structured logging is a way to log information in a consistent format, often in JSON, that allows logs to be treated as data rather than text, which makes querying and filtering simple. It gives developers the ability to efficiently store, retrieve, and analyze the logs programmatically. It also facilitates better debugging. Structured logging provides a simpler way to modify the verbosity of logs across different environments through log levels. Pay attention to logging levels. Logging too much will increase costs and decrease application throughput. Ensure personal identifiable information is redacted before logging. Here’s is an example of what structured logging looks like: { \"correlationId\": \"9ac54d82-75e0-4f0d-ae3c-e84ca400b3bd\", \"requestId\": \"58d9c96e-ae9f-43db-a353-c48e7a70bfa8\", \"level\": \"INFO\", \"message\": \"AccessDenied\", \"function-name\": \"demo-observability-function\", \"cold-start\": true } Prefer structured and centralized logging into CloudWatch logs to emit operational information about transactions, correlation identifiers across different components, and business outcomes from your application.","s":"Unstructured vs structured logs","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/serverless/aws-native/lambda-based-observability","h":"#unstructured-vs-structured-logs","p":596},{"i":605,"t":"Use CloudWatch Logs Insights, which can automatically discover fields in JSON formatted logs.

A correlation Id is a unique identifier assigned to a request at the very beginning. As the request moves through different services, the correlation Id is included in the logs, allowing you to trace the entire path of the request. You can either manually insert correlation Id to your AWS Lambda logs or use tools like AWS Lambda powertools to easily grab the correlation Id the from API Gateway and log it along with your application logs.

Pass the correlation id along with each request either as part of the custom header, body or metadata. Ensure that correlation Id is included in all the log entries and traces in your downstream services. You can either manually capture and include correlation Id as part of your Lambda function logs or use tools like AWS Lambda Powertools. With Lambda Powertools, you can easily grab the correlation Id from predefined request path mapping for supported upstream services and automatically add it alongside your application logs. Also, ensure that correlation Id is added to all your error messages to easily debug and identify the root cause in case of failures and tie it back to the original request. Let's look at the code sample to demostrate structured logging with correlation id and viewing it in CloudWatch for below serverless architecture: // Initializing Logger Logger log = LogManager.getLogger(); // Uses @Logger annotation from Lambda Powertools, which takes optional parameter correlationIdPath to extract correlation Id from the API Gateway header and inserts correlation_id to the Lambda function logs in a structured format. @Logging(correlationIdPath = \"/headers/path-to-correlation-id\") public APIGatewayProxyResponseEvent handleRequest(final APIGatewayProxyRequestEvent input, final Context context) { ... // The log statement below will also have additional correlation_id log.info(\"Success\") ... } In this example, a Java based Lambda function is using Lambda Powertools library to log correlation_id coming in from the api gateway request.

In addition, you can also write your custom queries and save them to re-run it again without having to re-create them each time. In CloudWatch logs insights, you can generate visualizations like line charts, bar charts, and stacked area charts from your queries with one or more aggregation functions. You can then easily add these visualization to the CloudWatch Dashboards. Sample dashboard below shows percentile report of Lambda function’s execution duration. Such dashboards will quickly give you insights on where you should focus on improve application performance. Average latency is a good metrics to look at but you should aim to optimize for p99 and not the average latency. To send (platform, function and extensions) logs to locations other than CloudWatch, you could use Lambda Telemetry API with Lambda Extensions. A number of partner solutions provide Lambda layers which use the Lambda Telemetry API and make integration with their systems easier.

AWS services provide a number of out-of-the-box standard metrics to help monitor the operational health of your application. Establish key metrics applicable for your application and use them for monitor performance of your application. Examples of key metrics may include function errors, queue depth, failed state machine executions, and api response times. One challenge with out-of-the-box metrics is knowing how to analyze them in a CloudWatch dashboard. For example, when looking at Concurrency, do I look at max, average, or percentile? And the right statistics to monitor differs for each metric. As best practices, for Lambda function’s ConcurrentExecutions metrics look at the Count statistics to check if it is getting close to the account and regional limit or close to the Lambda reserved concurrency limit if applicable. For Duration metric, which indicates how long your function takes to process an event, look at the Average or Max statistic. For measuring the latency of your API, look at the Percentile statistics for API Gateway’s Latency metrics. P50, P90, and P99 are much better methods of monitoring latency over averages. Once you know what metrics to monitor, configure alerts on these key metrics to engage you when components of your application are unhealthy. For Example For AWS Lambda, alert on Duration, Errors, Throttling, and ConcurrentExecutions. For stream-based invocations, alert on IteratorAge. For Asynchronous invocations, alert on DeadLetterErrors.

Evaluate KPIs to determine application success and operational health. Key metrics may vary depending on the type of application, but examples include site visited, orders placed, flights purchased, page load time, unique visitors etc. One way to publish custom metrics to AWS CloudWatch is by calling CloudWatch metrics SDK’s putMetricData API. However, putMetricData API call is synchronous. It will increase the duration of your Lambda function and it can potentially block other API calls in your application, leading to performance bottlenecks. Also, longer execution duration of your Lambda function will attribute towards higher cost. Additionally you are charged for both the number of custom metrics that are sent to CloudWatch and the number of API calls (i.e. PutMetricData API calls) that are made. A more efficient and cost-effective way to publish custom metrics is with CloudWatch Embedded Metrics Format (EMF). The CloudWatch Embedded Metric format allows you to generate custom metrics asynchronously as logs written to CloudWatch logs, resulting in improved performance of your application at a lower cost. With EMF, you can embed custom metrics alongside detailed log event data, and CloudWatch automatically extracts these custom metrics so that you can visualize and set alarm on them as you would do out-of-the-box metrics. By sending logs in the embedded metric format, you can query it using CloudWatch Logs Insights, and you only pay for the query, not the cost of the metrics. To achieve this, you can generate the logs using EMF specification, and send them to CloudWatch using PutLogEvents API. To simplify the process, there are two client libraries that support the creation of metrics in the EMF format.

Lambda Insights also collects, aggregates, and summarizes diagnostic information, such as cold starts and Lambda worker shutdowns. Lambda Insights leverages CloudWatch Lambda extension, which is packaged as a Lambda layer. Once enabled, it collects system-level metrics and emits a single performance log event to CloudWatch Logs for every invocation of that Lambda function in the embedded metrics format. note CloudWatch Lambda Insights is not enabled by default and needs to be turned on per Lambda function. You can enable it via AWS console or via Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Here is an example of how to enable it using the AWS serverless application model (SAM). You add LambdaInsightsExtension extension Layer to your Lambda function, and also add managed IAM policy CloudWatchLambdaInsightsExecutionRolePolicy, which gives permissions to your Lambda function to create log stream and call PutLogEvents API to be able to write logs to it. // Add LambdaInsightsExtension Layer to your function resource Resources: MyFunction: Type: AWS::Serverless::Function Properties: Layers: - !Sub \"arn:aws:lambda:${AWS::Region}:580247275435:layer:LambdaInsightsExtension:14\" // Add IAM policy to enable Lambda function to write logs to CloudWatch Resources: MyFunction: Type: AWS::Serverless::Function Properties: Policies: - `CloudWatchLambdaInsightsExecutionRolePolicy` You can then use CloudWatch console to view these system-level performance metrics under Lambda Insights.","s":"Use CloudWatch Lambda Insights to monitor system-level metrics","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/serverless/aws-native/lambda-based-observability","h":"#use-cloudwatch-lambda-insights-to-monitor-system-level-metrics","p":596},{"i":623,"t":"Creating CloudWatch Alarms and take necessary actions when metrics go off is a critical part of observability. Amazon CloudWatch alarms are used to alert you or automate remediation actions when application and infrastructure metrics exceed static or dynamically set thresholds. To set up an alarm for a metric, you select a threshold value that triggers a set of actions. A fixed threshold value is known as a static threshold. For instance, you can configure an alarm on Throttles metrics from Lambda function to activate if it exceeds 10% of the time within a 5-min period. This could potentially mean that Lambda function has reached its max concurrency for your account and region. In a serverless application, it is common to send an alert using SNS (Simple Notification Service). This enables users to receive alerts via email, SMS, or other channels. Additionally, you can subscribe a Lambda function to the SNS topic, allowing it to auto remediate any issues which caused the alarm to go off. For example, Let’s say you have a Lambda function A, which is polling an SQS queue and calling a downstream service. If downstream service is down and not responding, Lambda function will continue to poll from SQS and try calling downstream service with failures. While you can monitor these errors and generate a CloudWatch alarm using SNS to notify appropriate team, you can also call another Lambda function B (via SNS subscription), which can disable the event-source-mapping for the Lambda function A and thus stopping it from polling SQS queue, until the downstream service is back up and running. While setting up alarms on an individual metric is good, sometimes monitoring multiple metrics becomes necessary to better understand the operational health and performance of your application. In such a scenario, you should setup alarms based on multiple metrics using metric math expression. For example, if you want to monitor AWS Lambda errors but allow a small number of errors without triggering your alarm, y you can create an error rate expression in the form of a percentage. i.e. ErrorRate = errors / invocation * 100, then create an alarm to send an alert if the ErrorRate goes above 20% within the configured evaluation period.","s":"Creating CloudWatch Alarms","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/serverless/aws-native/lambda-based-observability","h":"#creating-cloudwatch-alarms","p":596},{"i":625,"t":"In this section of Observability best practices guide, we will deep dive on to following topics: Introduction to distributed tracing and AWS X-Ray Apply appropriate sampling rule Use X-Ray SDK to trace interaction with other services Code Sample for tracing integrated services using X-Ray SDK","s":"Tracing","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/serverless/aws-native/lambda-based-observability","h":"#tracing","p":596},{"i":627,"t":"Most serverless applications consist of multiple microservices, each using multiple AWS services. Due to the nature of serverless architectures, it’s crucial to have distributed tracing. For effective performance monitoring and error tracking, it is important to trace the transaction across entire application flow, from the source caller through all the downstream services. While it’s possible to achieve this using individual service’s logs, it’s faster and more efficient to use a tracing tool like AWS X-Ray. See Instrumenting your application with AWS X-Ray for more information. AWS X-Ray enables you to trace requests as it flows through the involved microservices. X-Ray Service maps enables you to understand different integration points and identify any performance degradation of your application. You can quickly isolate which component of you application is causing errors, throttling or having latency issues with just few clicks. Under the service graph, you can also individual traces to pinpoint the exact duration taken by each microservice. As a best practice, create custom subsegments in your code for downstream calls or any specific functionality that requires monitoring. For instance, you can create a subsegment to monitor a call to an external HTTP API, or an SQL database query. For example, To create a custom subsegment for a function that makes calls to downstream services, use the captureAsyncFunc function (in node.js) var AWSXRay = require('aws-xray-sdk'); app.use(AWSXRay.express.openSegment('MyApp')); app.get('/', function (req, res) { var host = 'api.example.com'; // start of the subsegment AWSXRay.captureAsyncFunc('send', function(subsegment) { sendRequest(host, function() { console.log('rendering!'); res.render('index'); // end of the subsegment subsegment.close(); }); }); }); In this example, the application creates a custom subsegment named send for calls to the sendRequest function. captureAsyncFunc passes a subsegment that you must close within the callback function when the asynchronous calls that it makes are complete.","s":"Introduction to distributed tracing and AWS X-Ray","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/guides/serverless/aws-native/lambda-based-observability","h":"#introduction-to-distributed-tracing-and-aws-x-ray","p":596},{"i":629,"t":"AWS X-Ray SDK does not trace all requests by default.

For instance, high-volume read-only calls, like background polling, or health checks can be sampled at a lower rate while still providing enough data to identify any potential issues that may arise. You may also want to have different sampling rate per environment. For instance, in your development environment, you may want all your requests to be traced to troubleshoot any errors or performance issues easily, whereas for production environment you may have lower number of traces.

According to Wikipedia, Observability is a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from the knowledge of its external outputs. The term observability itself originates from the field of control theory, where it basically means that you can infer the internal state of the components in a system by learning about the external signals/outputs it is producing. The difference between Monitoring and Observability is that Monitoring tells you whether a system is working or not, while Observability tells you why the system isn’t working. Monitoring is usually a reactive measure whereas the goal of Observability is to be able to improve your Key Performance Indicators in a proactive manner. A system cannot be controlled or optimized unless it is observed. Instrumenting workloads through collection of metrics, logs, or traces and gaining meaningful insights & detailed context using the right monitoring and observability tools help customers control and optimize the environment.

First, let's make sure Athena is set up and the datasets are loaded. warning You have to use the Amazon Athena console to execute these queries. Grafana in general has read-only access to the data sources, so can not be used to create or update data. Load geographical data​ In this first use case we use a dataset from the Registry of Open Data on AWS. More specifically, we will use OpenStreetMap (OSM) to demonstrate the usage of the Athena plugin for a geographical data motivated use case. For that to work, we need to first get the OSM data into Athena. So, first off, create a new database in Athena. Go to the Athena console and there use the following three SQL queries to import the OSM data into the database. Query 1: CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE planet ( id BIGINT, type STRING, tags MAP<STRING,STRING>, lat DECIMAL(9,7), lon DECIMAL(10,7), nds ARRAY<STRUCT<ref: BIGINT>>, members ARRAY<STRUCT<type: STRING, ref: BIGINT, role: STRING>>, changeset BIGINT, timestamp TIMESTAMP, uid BIGINT, user STRING, version BIGINT ) STORED AS ORCFILE LOCATION 's3://osm-pds/planet/'; Query 2: CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE planet_history ( id BIGINT, type STRING, tags MAP<STRING,STRING>, lat DECIMAL(9,7), lon DECIMAL(10,7), nds ARRAY<STRUCT<ref: BIGINT>>, members ARRAY<STRUCT<type: STRING, ref: BIGINT, role: STRING>>, changeset BIGINT, timestamp TIMESTAMP, uid BIGINT, user STRING, version BIGINT, visible BOOLEAN ) STORED AS ORCFILE LOCATION 's3://osm-pds/planet-history/'; Query 3: CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE changesets ( id BIGINT, tags MAP<STRING,STRING>, created_at TIMESTAMP, open BOOLEAN, closed_at TIMESTAMP, comments_count BIGINT, min_lat DECIMAL(9,7), max_lat DECIMAL(9,7), min_lon DECIMAL(10,7), max_lon DECIMAL(10,7), num_changes BIGINT, uid BIGINT, user STRING ) STORED AS ORCFILE LOCATION 's3://osm-pds/changesets/'; Load VPC flow logs data​ The second use case is a security-motivated one: analyzing network traffic using VPC Flow Logs. First, we need to tell EC2 to generate VPC Flow Logs for us. So, if you have not done this already, you go ahead now and create VPC flow logs either on the network interfaces level, subnet level, or VPC level. note To improve query performance and minimize the storage footprint, we store the VPC flow logs in Parquet, a columnar storage format that supports nested data. For our setup it doesn't matter what option you choose (network interfaces, subnet, or VPC), as long as you publish them to an S3 bucket in Parquet format as shown below: Now, again via the Athena console, create the table for the VPC flow logs data in the same database you imported the OSM data, or create a new one, if you prefer to do so. Use the following SQL query and make sure that you're replacing VPC_FLOW_LOGS_LOCATION_IN_S3 with your own bucket/folder: CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE vpclogs ( `version` int, `account_id` string, `interface_id` string, `srcaddr` string, `dstaddr` string, `srcport` int, `dstport` int, `protocol` bigint, `packets` bigint, `bytes` bigint, `start` bigint, `end` bigint, `action` string, `log_status` string, `vpc_id` string, `subnet_id` string, `instance_id` string, `tcp_flags` int, `type` string, `pkt_srcaddr` string, `pkt_dstaddr` string, `region` string, `az_id` string, `sublocation_type` string, `sublocation_id` string, `pkt_src_aws_service` string, `pkt_dst_aws_service` string, `flow_direction` string, `traffic_path` int ) STORED AS PARQUET LOCATION 'VPC_FLOW_LOGS_LOCATION_IN_S3' For example, VPC_FLOW_LOGS_LOCATION_IN_S3 could look something like the following if you're using the S3 bucket allmyflowlogs: s3://allmyflowlogs/AWSLogs/12345678901/vpcflowlogs/eu-west-1/2021/ Now that the datasets are available in Athena, let's move on to Grafana.","s":"Set up Amazon Athena","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/recipes/recipes/amg-athena-plugin","h":"#set-up-amazon-athena","p":867},{"i":876,"t":"We need a Grafana instance, so go ahead and set up a new Amazon Managed Grafana workspace, for example by using the Getting Started guide, or use an existing one. warning To use AWS data source configuration, first go to the Amazon Managed Grafana console to enable service-mananged IAM roles that grant the workspace the IAM policies necessary to read the Athena resources. Further, note the following: The Athena workgroup you plan to use needs to be tagged with the key GrafanaDataSource and value true for the service managed permissions to be permitted to use the workgroup. The service-managed IAM policy only grants access to query result buckets that start with grafana-athena-query-results-, so for any other bucket you MUST add permissions manually. You have to add the s3:Get* and s3:List* permissions for the underlying data source being queried manually. To set up the Athena data source, use the left-hand toolbar and choose the lower AWS icon and then choose \"Athena\". Select your default region you want the plugin to discover the Athena data source to use, and then select the accounts that you want, and finally choose \"Add data source\". Alternatively, you can manually add and configure the Athena data source by following these steps: Click on the \"Configurations\" icon on the left-hand toolbar and then on \"Add data source\". Search for \"Athena\". [OPTIONAL] Configure the authentication provider (recommended: workspace IAM role). Select your targeted Athena data source, database, and workgroup.

AWS has services like Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, which lets you scale out Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances based on metrics like CPU or memory utilization. Applications that use Prometheus metrics can easily integrate into EC2 Auto Scaling without needing to replace their monitoring stack. In this post, I will walk you through configuring Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to work with Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus Alert Manager. This approach lets you move a Prometheus-based workload to the cloud while taking advantage of services like autoscaling. Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus provides support for alerting rules that use PromQL. The Prometheus alerting rules documentation provides the syntax and examples of valid alerting rules. Likewise, the Prometheus alert manager documentation references both the syntax and examples of valid alert manager configurations.","s":"Auto-scaling Amazon EC2 using Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus and alert manager","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/recipes/recipes/as-ec2-using-amp-and-alertmanager","h":"","p":932},{"i":935,"t":"First, let’s briefly review Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling‘s concept of an Auto Scaling group which is a logical collection of Amazon EC2 instances. An Auto Scaling group can launch EC2 instances based on a predefined launch template. The launch template contains information used to launch the Amazon EC2 instance, including the AMI ID, the instance type, network settings, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) instance profile. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups have a minimum size, maximum size, and desired capacity concepts. When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling detects that the current running capacity of the Auto Scaling group is above or below the desired capacity, it will automatically scale out or scale in as needed. This scaling approach lets you utilize elasticity within your workload while still keeping bounds on both capacity and costs. To demonstrate this solution, I have created an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group that contains two Amazon EC2 instances. These instances remote write instance metrics to an Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace. I have set the Auto Scaling group’s minimum size to two (to maintain high availability), and I’ve set the group’s maximum size to 10 (to help control costs). As more traffic hits the solution, additional Amazon EC2 instances are automatically added to support the load, up to the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group’s maximum size. As the load decreases, those Amazon EC2 instances are terminated until the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group reaches the group’s minimum size. This approach lets you have a performant application by utilizing the elasticity of the cloud. Note that as you scrape more and more resources, you could quickly overwhelm the capabilities of a single Prometheus server. You can avoid this situation by scaling Prometheus servers linearly with the workload. This approach ensures that you can collect metric data at the granularity that you want. To support the Auto Scaling of a Prometheus workload, I have created an Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace with the following rules: YAML groups: - name: example rules: - alert: HostHighCpuLoad expr: 100 - (avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode=\"idle\"}[2m])) * 100) > 60 for: 5m labels: severity: warning event_type: scale_up annotations: summary: Host high CPU load (instance {{ $labels.instance }}) description: \"CPU load is > 60%\\n VALUE = {{ $value }}\\n LABELS = {{ $labels }}\" - alert: HostLowCpuLoad expr: 100 - (avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode=\"idle\"}[2m])) * 100) < 30 for: 5m labels: severity: warning event_type: scale_down annotations: summary: Host low CPU load (instance {{ $labels.instance }}) description: \"CPU load is < 30%\\n VALUE = {{ $value }}\\n LABELS = {{ $labels }}\" This rules set creates a HostHighCpuLoad and a HostLowCpuLoad rules. These alerts trigger when the CPU is greater than 60% or less than 30% utilization over a five-minute period. After raising an alert, the alert manager will forward the message into an Amazon SNS topic, passing an alert_type (the alert name) and event_type (scale_down or scale_up). YAML alertmanager_config: | route: receiver: default_receiver repeat_interval: 5m receivers: - name: default_receiver sns_configs: - topic_arn: <ARN OF SNS TOPIC GOES HERE> send_resolved: false sigv4: region: us-east-1 message: | alert_type: {{ .CommonLabels.alertname }} event_type: {{ .CommonLabels.event_type }} An AWS Lambda function is subscribed to the Amazon SNS topic. I have written logic in the Lambda function to inspect the Amazon SNS message and determine if a scale_up or scale_down event should happen. Then, the Lambda function increments or decrements the desired capacity of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. The Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group detects a requested change in capacity, and then invokes or deallocates Amazon EC2 instances. The Lambda code to support Auto Scaling is as follows: Python import json import boto3 import os def lambda_handler(event, context): print(event) msg = event['Records'][0]['Sns']['Message'] scale_type = '' if msg.find('scale_up') > -1: scale_type = 'scale_up' else: scale_type = 'scale_down' get_desired_instance_count(scale_type) def get_desired_instance_count(scale_type): client = boto3.client('autoscaling') asg_name = os.environ['ASG_NAME'] response = client.describe_auto_scaling_groups(AutoScalingGroupNames=[ asg_name]) minSize = response['AutoScalingGroups'][0]['MinSize'] maxSize = response['AutoScalingGroups'][0]['MaxSize'] desiredCapacity = response['AutoScalingGroups'][0]['DesiredCapacity'] if scale_type == \"scale_up\": desiredCapacity = min(desiredCapacity+1, maxSize) if scale_type == \"scale_down\": desiredCapacity = max(desiredCapacity - 1, minSize) print('Scale type: {}; new capacity: {}'.format(scale_type, desiredCapacity)) response = client.set_desired_capacity(AutoScalingGroupName=asg_name, DesiredCapacity=desiredCapacity, HonorCooldown=False) The full architecture can be reviewed in the following figure.","s":"Solution overview","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/recipes/recipes/as-ec2-using-amp-and-alertmanager","h":"#solution-overview","p":932},{"i":937,"t":"You can launch an AWS CloudFormation template to automatically provision this solution.

Once complete, you will find two Amazon EC2 instances that have been deployed and are running in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group that has been created for you. To validate that this solution auto-scales via Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus Alert Manager, you apply load to the Amazon EC2 instances using the AWS Systems Manager Run Command and the AWSFIS-Run-CPU-Stress automation document. As stress is applied to the CPUs in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group, alert manager publishes these alerts, which the Lambda function responds to by scaling up the Auto Scaling group. As CPU consumption decreases, the low CPU alert in the Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace fires, alert manager publishes the alert to the Amazon SNS topic, and the Lambda function responds by responds by scaling down the Auto Scaling group, as demonstrated in the following figure. The Grafana dashboard has a line showing that CPU has spiked to 100%. Although the CPU is high, another line shows that the number of instances has stepped up from 2 to 10.

You must deploy and manage a Prometheus server or an OpenTelemetry agent such as the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector or the Grafana Agent to perform this task. In this receipe, we walk you through the process of configuring the Grafana Agent to scrape the Envoy metrics and analyze them using AMP and AMG. Configure Grafana Agent​ The Grafana Agent is a lightweight alternative to running a full Prometheus server. It keeps the necessary parts for discovering and scraping Prometheus exporters and sending metrics to a Prometheus-compatible backend. The Grafana Agent also includes native support for AWS Signature Version 4 (Sigv4) for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication. We now walk you through the steps to configure an IAM role to send Prometheus metrics to AMP. We install the Grafana Agent on the EKS cluster and forward metrics to AMP. Configure permissions​ The Grafana Agent scrapes operational metrics from containerized workloads running in the EKS cluster and sends them to AMP. Data sent to AMP must be signed with valid AWS credentials using Sigv4 to authenticate and authorize each client request for the managed service. The Grafana Agent can be deployed to an EKS cluster to run under the identity of a Kubernetes service account. With IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA), you can associate an IAM role with a Kubernetes service account and thus provide IAM permissions to any pod that uses the service account. Prepare the IRSA setup as follows: kubectl create namespace grafana-agent export WORKSPACE=$(aws amp list-workspaces | jq -r '.workspaces[] | select(.alias==\"AMP-APPMESH\").workspaceId') export ROLE_ARN=$(aws iam get-role --role-name EKS-GrafanaAgent-AMP-ServiceAccount-Role --query Role.Arn --output text) export NAMESPACE=\"grafana-agent\" export REMOTE_WRITE_URL=\"https://aps-workspaces.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/workspaces/$WORKSPACE/api/v1/remote_write\" You can use the gca-permissions.sh shell script to automate the following steps (note to replace the placeholder variable YOUR_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your EKS cluster): Creates an IAM role named EKS-GrafanaAgent-AMP-ServiceAccount-Role with an IAM policy that has permissions to remote-write into an AMP workspace. Creates a Kubernetes service account named grafana-agent under the grafana-agent namespace that is associated with the IAM role. Creates a trust relationship between the IAM role and the OIDC provider hosted in your Amazon EKS cluster. You need kubectl and eksctl CLI tools to run the gca-permissions.sh script. They must be configured to access your Amazon EKS cluster. Now create a manifest file, grafana-agent.yaml, with the scrape configuration to extract Envoy metrics and deploy the Grafana Agent. note At time of writing, this solution will not work for EKS on Fargate due to the lack of support for daemon sets there. The example deploys a daemon set named grafana-agent and a deployment named grafana-agent-deployment. The grafana-agent daemon set collects metrics from pods on the cluster and the grafana-agent-deployment deployment collects metrics from services that do not live on the cluster, such as the EKS control plane. kubectl apply -f grafana-agent.yaml After the grafana-agent is deployed, it will collect the metrics and ingest them into the specified AMP workspace.

Typically, logs are delivered to a file, though sometimes they are sent to a collector that performs analysis and aggregation. There are many full-featured log aggregators, frameworks, and products that aim to make the task of generating, ingesting, and managing log data at any volume – from megabytes per day to terabytes per hour. Logs are emitted by a single application at a time and usually pertain to the scope of that one application - though developers are free to have logs be as complex and nuanced as they desire. For our purposes we consider logs to be a fundamentally different signal from traces, which are composed of events from more than one application or a service, and with context about the connection between services such as response latency, service faults, request parameters etc. Data in logs can also be aggregate over a period of time. For example, they may be statistical (e.g. number of requests served over the previous minute). They can be structured, free-form, verbose, and in any written language. The primary use cases for logging are describing, an event, including its status and duration, and other vital statistics errors or warnings related to that event (e.g. stack traces, timeouts) application launches, start-up and shutdown messages note Logs are intended to be immutable, and many log management systems include mechanisms to protect against, and detect attempts, to modify log data.

Of these three examples, only the first one is easily parsed by both humans and a log aggregation system. Using structured logs makes it easy to process log data quickly and effectively, giving both humans and machines the data they need to immediately find what they are looking for. The most commonly understood log format is JSON, wherein each component to an event is represented as a key/value pair. In JSON, the python example above may be rewritten to look like this: { \"level\", \"ERROR\" \"file\": \"e.py\", \"line\": 7, \"error\": \"TypeError(\\\"Again !?!\\\")\" } The use of structured logs makes your data transportable from one log system to another, simplifies development, and make operational diagnosis faster (with less errors).

Too many alarms, without identifiable actions and priorities, can overload your team and lead to inefficiencies. Alarms should be for things which are important to you, and actionable. Dashboards are more flexible here. They don't demand your attention in the same way, so you have more freedom to visualize things that you may not be certain are important yet, or that support your exploration. Still, don't over do it! Everything can suffer from too much of a good thing. Dashboards should provide a picture of something that is important to you. In the same was as deciding what data to ingest, you need to think about what matters to you for dashboards. For your dashboards, think about Who will be viewing this? What is their background and knowledge? How much context do they need? What questions are they trying to answer? What actions will they be taking as a result of seeing this data? tip Sometimes it can be hard to know what your dashboard story should be, and how much to include. So where could you start to design your dashboard? Lets look at two ways: KPI driven, or incident driven. Design your dashboard: KPI driven​ One way to understand this is to work back from your KPIs. This is usually a very user driven approach. For layout, typically we are working top down, getting to more detail as we move further down a dashboard, or navigate to lower level dashboards. First, understand your KPIs. What they mean. This wil help you decide how you want to visualize these. Many KPIs are shown as a single number. For example, what percentage of customers are successfully completing a specific workflow, and in what time? But over what time period? You may well meet your KPI if you average over a week, but still have smaller periods of time within this that breach your standards. Are these breaches important to you? Do they impact your customer experience. If so, you may consider different periods and time charts to see your KPIs. And maybe not everyone needs to see the detail, so perhaps you move the breakdown of KPIs to a separate dashboard, for a separate audience. Next, what contribute to those KPIs? What workflows need to be running in order for those actions to happen? Can you measure these? Identify the main components and add visualizations of their performance. When a KPI breeches, you should be able to quickly look and see where in the workflow the main impact is. And you can keep going down - what impacts the perfomance of those workflows? Remember your audience as you decide the level of depth. Consider the example of an e-commerce system with a KPI for the number of order placed. For an order to be placed, users must be able to perform the following action: search for products, add them to their cart, add their delivery details, and pay for the order. For each of these workflows, you might consider checking key components are functioning. For example by using RUM or Synthetics to get data on action success and see if the user is being impacted by an issue. You might consider a measurement of throughput, latency, failed action percentages to see if the performance of each action is as expected. You might consider measurements of the underlying infrastructure to see what might be impacting performance. However, don't put all of your information on the same dashboard. Again, consider your user audience. info Create layers of dashboards that allow drilldown and provide the right context for the right users. Design your dashboard: Incident driven​ For many people, incident resolution is a key driver for observability. You have been alerted to an issue, by a user, or by an Observability alarm, and you need to quickly find a fix and potentially a root cause of the issue. info Start by looking at your recent incidents. Are there common patterns? Which were the most impactful for your company? Which ones repeat? In this case, we're designing a dashboard for those trying to understand the severity, identify the root cause and fix the incident. Think back to the specific indcident. How did you verify the incident was as reported? What did you check? Endpoints? Errors? How did you understand the impact, and therefore priority of the issue? What did you look at for cause of the issue? Application Performance Monitoring (APM) can help here, with Synthetics for regular baseline and testing of endpoints and workflows, and RUM for the actual customer experience. You can use this data to quickly visualize which workflows are impacted, and by how much. Visualizations which show the error count over time, and the top # errors, can help you to focus on the right area, and show you specific details of errors. This is where we are often using log data, and dynamic visualizations of error codes and reasons. It can be very useful here to have some kind of filtering or drilldown, to get to the specifics as quickly as possible. Think about ways to implement this without too much overhead. For example, having a single dashboard which you can filter to get closer to the details.","s":"Don't try to visualize everything all at once","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/tools/dashboards","h":"#dont-try-to-visualize-everything-all-at-once","p":1197},{"i":1212,"t":"The layout of your dashboard is also important. info Typically the most significant visualizations for your user want to be top left, or otherwise aligned with a natural beginning of page navigation. You can use layout to help tell the story. For example, you may use a top-down layout, where the further down you scroll, the more details you see.

For example you may have your instances in an autoscaling group, and when you hit a certain load, additional instances are added. info A dashboard showing data from specific instances, specified by some kind of ID, will not allow the data from those new instances to be seen. Add metadata to your resources and data, so you can create your visualizations to capture all instances with a specific metadata value. This way they will reflect the actual state. Another example of dynamic visualizations might be being able to find the top 10 errors occurring now, and how they have behaved over recent history.

Unlike logs or metrics, traces are composed of events from more than one application or a service, and with context about the connection between services such as response latency, service faults, request parameters, and metadata. tip There is conceptual similarity between logs and traces, however a trace is intended to be considered in a cross-service context, whereas logs are typically limited to the execution of a single service or application. tip Today's developers are leaning towards building modular and distributed applications. Some call these Service Oriented Architecture, others will refer to them as microservices. Regardless of the name, when something goes wrong in these loosely coupled applications, just looking at logs or events may not be sufficient to track down the root cause of an incident. Having full visibility into request flow is essential and this is where traces add value. Through a series of causally related events that depict end-to-end request flow, traces help you gain that visibility. Traces are an essential pillar of observability because they provide the basic information on the flow of the request as it comes and leaves the system. tip Common use cases for traces include performance profiling, debugging production issues, and root cause analysis of failures.","s":"Traces","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/signals/traces","h":"","p":1223},{"i":1226,"t":"When all of your workload functionality and code is at one place, it is easy to look at the source code to see how a request is passed across different functions.

Logging into numerous systems to see their logs from each interconnected request would be impractical, if not impossible. This is where observability can help. Instrumentation is a key step towards increasing that observability. In broader terms Instrumentation is measuring the events in your application using code. A typical instrumentation approach would be to assign a unique trace identifier for each request entering the system and carry that trace id as it passes through different components while adding additional metadata. info Every connection from one service to another should be instrumented to emit traces to a central collector.

This information is useful for debugging because it gives you the exact time and location a problem occurred. This is best explained through a practical example. An e-commerce application may be divided into many domains: authentication, authorization, shipping, inventory, payment processing, fulfillment, product search, recommendations, and many more. Rather than search through traces from all of these interconnected domains though, labelling your trace with a customer ID allows you to search for only interactions that are specific to this one person. This helps you to narrow your search instantly when diagnosing an operational issue. info While the naming convention may vary between vendors, each trace can be augmented with metadata, labels, or annotations, and these are searchable across your entire workload. Adding them does require code on your part, but greatly increases the observability of your workload. warning Traces are not logs, so be frugal with what metadata you include in your traces.

While you can set this in the CloudWatch console at any time, the best practice is to do so either in-tandem with the log group creation using infrastructure as code (CloudFormation, Cloud Development Kit, etc.) or using the retention_in_days setting inside of the CloudWatch agent configuration. Either approach lets you set the log retention period proactively, and aligned with your project's data retention requirements. info Log group data is always encrypted in CloudWatch Logs. By default, CloudWatch Logs uses server-side encryption for the log data at rest. As an alternative, you can use AWS Key Management Service for this encryption. Encryption using AWS KMS is enabled at the log group level, by associating a KMS key with a log group, either when you create the log group or after it exists. This can be configured using infrastructure as code (CloudFormation, Cloud Development Kit, etc.). Using AWS Key Management Service to manage keys for CloudWatch Logs requires additional configuration and granting permissions to the keys for your users.1","s":"Log groups","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/tools/logs/","h":"#log-groups","p":1260},{"i":1268,"t":"CloudWatch Logs has the capability to automatically discover log fields and index JSON data upon ingestion.

Unstructured logging data won't be automatically indexed but can still be delivered to CloudWatch Logs. Unstructured logs can still be searched or queried using a regular expression with parse command. info The two best practices for log formats when using CloudWatch Logs: Use a structured log formatter such as Log4j, python-json-logger, or your framework's native JSON emitter.

However, for workloads that handle specific types of known undesirable data (e.g. credit card numbers, Social Security numbers), having a filter for these records can prevent a potentially damaging compliance issue in the future. For example, dropping all records that contain a Social Security number can be as simple as this configuration: \"filters\": [ { \"type\": \"exclude\", \"expression\": \"\\b(?!000|666|9\\d{2})([0-8]\\d{2}|7([0-6]\\d))([-]?|\\s{1})(?!00)\\d\\d\\2(?!0000)\\d{4}\\b\" } ]","s":"Filtering logs","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/tools/logs/","h":"#filtering-logs","p":1260},{"i":1274,"t":"The best practice for all logging is to use structured logging with a single line emitted for every discrete log event.

For example, you can write a metric math expression to find out the Lambda error rate by query as: Errors/Requests Below you see an example of how this can appear in the CloudWatch console: info Use metric math to get the most value from your data and derive values from the performance of separate data sources. CloudWatch also supports conditional statements. For example, to return a value of 1 for each timeseries where latency is over a specific threshold, and 0 for all other data points, a query would resemble this: IF(latency>threshold, 1, 0) In the CloudWatch console we can use this logic to create boolean values, which in turn can trigger CloudWatch alarms or other actions. This can enable automatic actions from derived datapoints. An example from the CloudWatch console is below: info Use conditional statements to trigger alarms and notifications when performance exceeds thresholds for derived values. You can also use a SEARCH function to show the top n for any metric. When visualizing the best or worst performing metrics across a large number timeseries (e.g. thousands of servers) this approach allows you to see only the data that matters most. Here is an example of a search returning the top two CPU-consuming EC2 instances, averaged over the last five minutes: SLICE(SORT(SEARCH('{AWS/EC2,InstanceId} MetricName=\"CPUUtilization\"', 'Average', 300), MAX, DESC),0, 2) And a view of the same in the CloudWatch console: info Use the SEARCH approach to rapidly display the valuable or worst performing resources in your environment, and then display these in dashboards.","s":"Querying metrics","u":"/observability-best-practices/docs/tools/metrics","h":"#querying-metrics","p":1326},{"i":1333,"t":"If you would like to have additional metrics like memory or disk space utilization for your EC2 instances, you use the CloudWatch agent to push this data to CloudWatch on your behalf.

PutMetricData API calls are charges on number of queries. The best practise to use the PutMetricData API optimally. Using the Values and Counts method in this API, enables you to publish up to 150 values per metric with one PutMetricData request, and supports retrieving percentile statistics on this data. Thus, instead of making separate API calls for each of the datapoint, you should group all your datapoints together and then push to CloudWatch in a single PutMetricData API call. This approach benefits the user in two ways: CloudWatch pricing PutMetricData API throttling can be prevented info When using PutMetricData, the best practice is to batch your data into single PUT operations whenever possible. info If large volumes of metrics are emitted into CloudWatch then consider using Embedded Metric Format as an alternative approach.

The scope of features for general availability may change from what you experience today. Collecting telemetry from all tiers of your workload is a best practice, and one that can be a challenge.

And those operating web applications can use Real User Monitoring(RUM) to observe the health of these apps as experienced by end users. But what about the traffic between the client and the datacenter or cloud services provider? And for applications that are not served as web pages and therefore cannot use RUM? Internet Monitor works at the networking level and evaluates the health of observed traffic, correlated against AWS existing knowledge of known Internet issues. In short, if there is an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that has a performance or availability issue and if your application has traffic that uses this ISP for client/server communication, then Internet Monitor can proactively inform you about this impact to your workload. Additionally, it can make recommendations to you based on your selected hosting region and use of CloudFront as a Content Delivery Network1. tip Internet Monitor only evaluates traffic from networks that your workloads traverse.
