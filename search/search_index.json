See our documentation for updated list of Regions that we support. We plan to support all commercial regions in 2023. Please let us know which regions you would like so that we can better prioritize our existing Product Feature Requests (PFRs). You can always collect data from any regions and send it to a specific region that we support. Here\u2019s a blog for more details: Cross-region metrics collection for Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus.</li> <li>How long does it take to see metering and/or billing in Cost Explorer or  CloudWatch as AWS billing charges?     We meter blocks of ingested metric samples as soon as they are uploaded to S3 every 2 hours. It can take up to 3 hours to see metering and charges reported for Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus.</li> <li>As far as I can see the Prometheus Service is only able to scrape metrics from a cluster (EKS/ECS) Is that correct?     We apologize for the lack of documentation for other compute environments. You can use Prometheus server to scrape Prometheus metrics from EC2 and any other compute environments where you can install a Prometheus server today as long as you configure the remote write and setup the AWS SigV4 proxy. The link to the EC2 blog has a section \u201cRunning aws-sigv4-proxy\u201d that can show you how to run it. We do need to add more documentation to help our customers simplify how to run AWS SigV4 on other compute environments.</li> <li>How would one connect this service to Grafana? Is there some documentation about this?     We use the default Prometheus data source available in Grafana to query Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus using PromQL. Here\u2019s some documentation and a blog that will help you get started:<ol> <li>Service docs</li> <li>Grafana setup on EC2</li> </ol> </li> <li>What are some of the best practices to reduce the number of samples being sent to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus?     To reduce the number of samples being ingested into Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, customers can extend their scrape interval (e.g., change from 30s to 1min) or decrease the number of series they are scraping. Changing the scrape interval will have a more dramatic impact on the number of samples than decreasing the number of series, with doubling the scrape interval halving the volume of samples ingested.</li> <li> <p>How to send CloudWatch metrics to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus?     We recommend utilizing CloudWatch metric streams to send CloudWatch metrics to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. Some possible shortcomings of this integration are,</p> <ol> <li>A Lambda function is required to call the Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus APIs,</li> <li>No ability to enrich CloudWatch metrics with metadata (e.g., with AWS tags) before ingesting them to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus,</li> <li>Metrics can only be filtered by namespace (not granular enough). As an alternative, customers can utilize Prometheus Exporters to send CloudWatch metrics data to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus: (1) CloudWatch  Exporter: Java based scraping that uses CW ListMetrics and  GetMetricStatistics (GMS) APIs.</li> </ol> <p>Yet Another CloudWatch Exporter (YACE) is another option to get metrics from CloudWatch into Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. This is a Go based tool that uses the CW ListMetrics, GetMetricData (GMD), and  GetMetricStatistics (GMS) APIs. Some disadvantages in using this could be that you will have to deploy the agent and have to manage the life-cycle yourself which has to be done thoughtfully.</p> </li> <li> <p>What version of Prometheus are you compatible with?     Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is compatible with Prometheus 2.x. Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is based on the open source CNCF Cortex project as its data plane. Cortex strives to be 100% API compatible with Prometheus (under /prometheus/ and /api/prom/). Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus supports Prometheus-compatible PromQL queries and Remote write metric ingestion and the Prometheus data model for existing metric types including Gauge, Counters, Summary, and Histogram. We do not currently expose all Cortex APIs. The list of compatible APIs we support can be found here. Customers can work with their account team to open new or influence existing Product Features Requests (PFRs) if we are missing any features required from Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus.</p> </li> <li>What collector do you recommend for ingesting metrics into Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus? Should I utilize Prometheus in Agent mode?     We support the usage of Prometheus servers inclusive of agent mode, the OpenTelemetry agent, and the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry agent as agents that customers can use to send metrics data to Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus. The AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry is a downstream distribution of the OpenTelemetry project packaged and secured by AWS. Any of the three should be fine, and you\u2019re welcome to pick whichever best suits your individual team\u2019s needs and preferences.</li> <li>How does Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus\u2019s performance scale with the size of a workspace?     Currently, Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus supports up to 200M active time series in a single workspace. When we announce a new max limit, we\u2019re ensuring that the performance and reliability properties of the service continue to be maintained across ingest and query. Queries across the same size dataset should not see a performance degradation regardless of the number of active series in a workspace.</li> <li>Product FAQ https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/faqs/</li> </ol>"},{"location":"faq/cloudwatch/","title":"Amazon CloudWatch - FAQ","text":"<p>Why should I choose Amazon CloudWatch?</p> <p>Amazon CloudWatch is an AWS cloud native service which provides unified observability on a single platform for monitoring AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS.

AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) is a secure, AWS-supported distribution of the OpenTelemetry project. With ADOT, users can instrument their applications just once to send correlated metrics and traces to multiple monitoring solutions. With ADOT support for CloudWatch Container Insights, customers can collect system metrics such as CPU, memory, disk, and network usage from Amazon EKS clusters running on Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (Amazon EC2), providing the same experience as Amazon CloudWatch agent. ADOT Collector is now available with support for CloudWatch Container Insights for Amazon EKS and AWS Fargate profile for Amazon EKS. Customers can now collect container and pod metrics such as CPU and memory utilization for their pods that are deployed to an Amazon EKS cluster and view them in CloudWatch dashboards without any changes to their existing CloudWatch Container Insights experience. This will enable customers to also determine whether to scale up or down to respond to traffic and save costs.</p> <p>The ADOT Collector has the concept of a pipeline which comprises three key types of components, namely, receiver, processor, and exporter. A receiver is how data gets into the collector. It accepts data in a specified format, translates it into the internal format and passes it to processors and exporters defined in the pipeline. It can be pull or push based. A processor is an optional component that is used to perform tasks such as batching, filtering, and transformations on data between being received and being exported. An exporter is used to determine which destination to send the metrics, logs or traces. The collector architecture allows multiple instances of such pipelines to be defined via YAML configuration. The following diagrams illustrates the pipeline components in an ADOT Collector instance deployed to Amazon EKS and Amazon EKS with Fargate profile.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure: Pipeline components in an ADOT Collector instance deployed to Amazon EKS</p> <p>In the above architecture, we are deploying we are using an instance of AWS Container Insights Receiver in the pipeline and collect the metrics directly from the Kubelet. AWS Container Insights Receiver (<code>awscontainerinsightreceiver</code>) is an AWS specific receiver that supports CloudWatch Container Insights. CloudWatch Container Insights collect, aggregate, and summarize metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices. Data are collected as as performance log events using embedded metric format. From the EMF data, Amazon CloudWatch can create the aggregated CloudWatch metrics at the cluster, node, pod, task, and service level. Below is an example of a sample <code>awscontainerinsightreceiver</code> configuration :</p> <pre><code>receivers:\n  awscontainerinsightreceiver:\n    # all parameters are optional\n    collection_interval: 60s\n    container_orchestrator: eks\n    add_service_as_attribute: true \n    prefer_full_pod_name: false \n    add_full_pod_name_metric_label: false \n</code></pre> <p>This entails deploying the collector as a DaemonSet using the above configuration on Amazon EKS. You will also have access to a fuller set of metrics collected by this receiver directly from the Kubelet. Having more than one instances of ADOT Collector will suffice to collect resource metrics from all the nodes in a cluster. Having a single instance of ADOT collector can be overwhelming during higher loads so always recommend to deploy more than one collector.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure: Pipeline components in an ADOT Collector instance deployed to Amazon EKS with Fargate profile</p> <p>In the above architecture, the kubelet on a worker node in a Kubernetes cluster exposes resource metrics such as CPU, memory, disk, and network usage at the /metrics/cadvisor endpoint. However, in EKS Fargate networking architecture, a pod is not allowed to directly reach the kubelet on that worker node. Hence, the ADOT Collector calls the Kubernetes API Server to proxy the connection to the kubelet on a worker node, and collect kubelet\u2019s cAdvisor metrics for workloads on that node. These metrics are made available in Prometheus format. Therefore, the collector uses an instance of Prometheus Receiver as a drop-in replacement for a Prometheus server and scrapes these metrics from the Kubernetes API server endpoint. Using Kubernetes service discovery, the receiver can discover all the worker nodes in an EKS cluster. Hence, more than one instances of ADOT Collector will suffice to collect resource metrics from all the nodes in a cluster. Having a single instance of ADOT collector can be overwhelming during higher loads so always recommend to deploy more than one collector.</p> <p>The metrics then go through a series of processors that perform filtering, renaming, data aggregation and conversion, and so on. The following is the list of processors used in the pipeline of an ADOT Collector instance for Amazon EKS illustrated above.</p> <ul> <li>Filter Processor is part of the AWS OpenTelemetry distribution to include or exclude metrics based on their name. It can be used as part of the metrics collection pipeline to filter out unwanted metrics. For example, suppose that you want Container Insights to only collect pod-level metrics (with name prefix <code>pod_</code>) excluding those for networking, with name prefix <code>pod_network</code>.</li> </ul> <pre><code>      # filter out only renamed metrics which we care about\n      filter:\n        metrics:\n          include:\n            match_type: regexp\n            metric_names:\n              - new_container_.*\n              - pod_.*\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Metrics Transform Processor can be used to rename metrics, and add, rename or delete label keys and values.

It\u2019s also fully compatible with Docker and Kubernetes environments. Using the newly launched Fluent Bit daemonset, you can send container logs from your EKS clusters to CloudWatch logs for logs storage and analytics.</p> <p>Due to its lightweight nature, using Fluent Bit as the default log forwarder in Container Insights on EKS worker nodes will allow you to stream application logs into CloudWatch logs efficiently and reliably. With Fluent Bit, Container Insights is able to deliver thousands of business critical logs at scale in a resource efficient manner, especially in terms of CPU and memory utilization at the pod level. In other words, compared to FluentD, which was the log forwarder used prior, Fluent Bit has a smaller resource footprint and, as a result, is more resource efficient for memory and CPU. On the other hand, AWS for Fluent Bit image, which includes Fluent Bit and related plugins, gives Fluent Bit an additional flexibility of adopting new AWS features faster as the image aims to provide a unified experience within AWS ecosystem.</p> <p>The architecture below shows individual components used by CloudWatch Container Insights for EKS:</p> <p></p> <p>Figure: Individual components used by CloudWatch Container Insights for EKS.</p> <p>While working with containers, it is recommended to push all the logs, including application logs, through the standard output (stdout) and standard error output (stderr) methods whenever possible using the Docker JSON logging driver. For this reason, in EKS, the logging driver is configured by default and everything that a containerized application writes to <code>stdout</code> or <code>stderr</code> is streamed into a JSON file under <code>\u201c/var/log/containers\"</code> on the worker node. Container Insights classifies those logs into three different categories by default and creates dedicated input streams for each category within Fluent Bit and independent log groups within CloudWatch Logs. Those categories are:</p> <ul> <li>Application logs: All applications logs stored under <code>\u201c/var/log/containers/*.log\"</code> are streamed into the dedicated <code>/aws/containerinsights/Cluster_Name/application</code> log group. All non-application logs such as kube-proxy and aws-node logs are excluded by default. However, additional Kubernetes add-on logs, such as CoreDNS logs, are also processed and streamed into this log group.</li> <li>Host logs: system logs for each EKS worker node are streamed into the <code>/aws/containerinsights/Cluster_Name/host</code> log group. These system logs include the contents of <code>\u201c/var/log/messages,/var/log/dmesg,/var/log/secure\u201d</code> files. Considering the stateless and dynamic nature of containerized workloads, where EKS worker nodes are often being terminated during scaling activities, streaming those logs in real time with Fluent Bit and having those logs available in CloudWatch logs, even after the node is terminated, are critical in terms of observability and monitoring health of EKS worker nodes. It also enables you to debug or troubleshoot cluster issues without logging into worker nodes in many cases and analyze these logs in more systematic way.</li> <li>Data plane logs: EKS already provides control plane logs. With Fluent Bit integration in Container Insights, the logs generated by EKS data plane components, which run on every worker node and are responsible for maintaining running pods are captured as data plane logs. These logs are also streamed into a dedicated CloudWatch log group under <code>\u2018 /aws/containerinsights/Cluster_Name/dataplane</code>. kube-proxy, aws-node, and Docker runtime logs are saved into this log group. In addition to control plane logs, having data plane logs stored in CloudWatch Logs helps to provide a complete picture of your EKS clusters.</li> </ul> <p>Further, Please learn more on topics such as Fluent Bit Configurations, Fluent Bit Monitoring and Log analysis from Fluent Bit Integration with Amazon EKS.</p>"},{"location":"guides/containers/aws-native/eks/amazon-cloudwatch-container-insights/#cost-savings-with-container-insights-on-amazon-eks","title":"Cost savings with Container Insights on Amazon EKS","text":"<p>With the default configuration, the Container Insights receiver collects the complete set of metrics as defined by the receiver documentation.

The metric_declaration section of CloudWatch EMF exporter configuration can be used to define the set of metrics and dimensions that you want to export. For example, you can keep only pod metrics from the default configuration. This <code>metric_declaration</code> section will look like the following and to reduce the number of metrics, you can keep the dimension set only <code>[PodName, Namespace, ClusterName]</code> if you do not care about others:</p> <pre><code>  awsemf:\n    namespace: ContainerInsights\n    log_group_name: '/aws/containerinsights/{ClusterName}/performance'\n    log_stream_name: '{NodeName}'\n    resource_to_telemetry_conversion:\n      enabled: true\n    dimension_rollup_option: NoDimensionRollup\n    parse_json_encoded_attr_values: [Sources, kubernetes]\n    # Customized metric declaration section\n    metric_declarations:\n      # pod metrics\n      - dimensions: [[PodName, Namespace, ClusterName]]\n        metric_name_selectors:\n          - pod_cpu_utilization\n          - pod_memory_utilization\n          - pod_cpu_utilization_over_pod_limit\n          - pod_memory_utilization_over_pod_limit\n</code></pre> <p>This configuration will produce and stream the following four metrics within single dimension <code>[PodName, Namespace, ClusterName]</code> rather than 55 different metrics for multiple dimensions in the default configuration:</p> <ul> <li>pod_cpu_utilization</li> <li>pod_memory_utilization</li> <li>pod_cpu_utilization_over_pod_limit</li> <li>pod_memory_utilization_over_pod_limit</li> </ul> <p>With this configuration, you will only send the metrics that you are interested in rather than all the metrics configured by default. As a result, you will be able to decrease metric ingestion cost for Container Insights considerably. Having this flexibility will provide Container Insights costumers with high level of control over metrics being exported. Customizing metrics by modifying the <code>awsemf</code> exporter configuration is also highly flexible, and you can customize both the metrics that you want to send and their dimensions. Note that this is only applicable to logs that are sent to CloudWatch.</p> <p>The two approaches demonstrated discussed above are not mutually exclusive with each other. In fact, they both can be combined for a high degree of flexibility in customizing metrics that we want ingested into our monitoring system. We use this approach to decrease costs associated with metric storage and processing, as show in following graph.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure: AWS Cost Explorer</p> <p>In the preceding AWS Cost Explorer graph, we can see daily cost associated with CloudWatch using different configurations on the ADOT Collector in a small EKS cluster (20 Worker nodes, 220 pods).

On Aug 17th, we used the Processors approach, which achieves about 45% costs saving. You must consider the trade-offs of customizing metrics sent by Container Insights as you will be able to decrease monitoring costs by sacrificing visibility of the monitored cluster.

See Instrumenting your application for more information.</p> <p>We will learn about about containerized application tracing by collect traces from your Amazon EKS cluster using Amazon EKS add-ons for AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry. </p>"},{"location":"guides/containers/aws-native/eks/container-tracing-with-aws-xray/#traces-collection-using-amazon-eks-add-ons-for-aws-distro-for-opentelemetry","title":"Traces collection using Amazon EKS add-ons for AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry","text":"<p>AWS X-Ray provides application-tracing functionality, giving deep insights into all microservices deployed.

Users can instrument their applications just once and, using ADOT, send correlated metrics and traces to multiple monitoring solutions. Amazon EKS now allows users to enable ADOT as an add-on at any time after the cluster is up and running. The ADOT add-on includes the latest security patches and bug fixes and is validated by AWS to work with Amazon EKS.</p> <p>The ADOT add-on is an implementation of a Kubernetes Operator, which is a software extension to Kubernetes that makes use of custom resources to manage applications and their components. The add-on watches for a custom resource named OpenTelemetryCollector and manages the lifecycle of an ADOT Collector based on the configuration settings specified in the custom resource.</p> <p>The ADOT Collector has the concept of a pipeline that comprises three key types of components, namely, receiver, processor, and exporter. A receiver is how data gets into the collector. It accepts data in a specific format, translates it into the internal format, and passes it to processors and exporters defined in the pipeline. It can be pull- or push-based. A processor is an optional component that is used to perform tasks such as batching, filtering, and transformations on data between being received and being exported. An exporter is used to determine which destination to send the metrics, logs, or traces to. The collector architecture allows multiple instances of such pipelines to be set up via a Kubernetes YAML manifest.</p> <p>The following diagram illustrates an ADOT Collector configured with a traces pipeline, which sends telemetry data to AWS X-Ray.

The Kubernetes control plane is a set of components that manage Kubernetes clusters and produce logs used for auditing and diagnostic purposes. With Amazon EKS, you can turn on logs for different control plane components and send them to CloudWatch.</p> <p>Kubernetes also runs system components such as <code>kubelet</code> and <code>kube-proxy</code> on each Kubernetes node that runs your pods. These components write logs within each node and you can configure CloudWatch and Container Insights to capture these logs for each Amazon EKS node.</p> <p>Containers are grouped as pods within a Kubernetes cluster and are scheduled to run on your Kubernetes nodes. Most containerized applications write to standard output and standard error, and the container engine redirects the output to a logging driver. In Kubernetes, the container logs are found in the <code>/var/log/pods</code> directory on a node. You can configure CloudWatch and Container Insights to capture these logs for each of your Amazon EKS pods.</p> <p>There are three common approaches for capturing logs Shipping container logs to a centralized log aggregation system in Kubernetes:</p> <ul> <li>Node level agent, like a Fluentd daemonset. This is the recommended pattern.</li> <li>Sidecar container, like a Fluentd sidecar container.</li> <li>Directly writing to log collection system. In this approach, the application is responsible for shipping the logs. This is the least recommended option because you will have to include the log aggregation system\u2019s SDK in your application code instead of reusing community build solutions like Fluentd. This pattern also disobeys the principle of separation of concerns, according to which, logging implementation should be independent of the application. Doing so allows you to change the logging infrastructure without impacting or changing your application.</li> </ul> <p>We will now dive in to each of these logging categories for Amazon EKS logging along with talking about unified log aggregation from Amazon EKS and other compute platforms.</p>"},{"location":"guides/containers/aws-native/eks/log-aggregation/#amazon-eks-control-plane-logging","title":"Amazon EKS control plane logging","text":"<p>An Amazon EKS cluster consists of a high availability, single-tenant control plane for your Kubernetes cluster and the Amazon EKS nodes that run your containers. The control plane nodes run in an account managed by AWS. The Amazon EKS cluster control plane nodes are integrated with CloudWatch and you can turn on logging for specific control plane components. Logs are provided for each Kubernetes control plane component instance. AWS manages the health of your control plane nodes and provides a service-level agreement (SLA) for the Kubernetes endpoint.</p> <p>Amazon EKS control plane logging consists of following cluster control plane log types. Each log type corresponds to a component of the Kubernetes control plane. To learn more about these components, see Kubernetes Components in the Kubernetes documentation.</p> <ul> <li>API server (<code>api</code>) \u2013 Your cluster's API server is the control plane component that exposes the Kubernetes API. If you enable API server logs when you launch the cluster, or shortly thereafter, the logs include API server flags that were used to start the API server. For more information, see <code>kube-apiserver</code> and the audit policy in the Kubernetes documentation.</li> <li>Audit (<code>audit</code>) \u2013 Kubernetes audit logs provide a record of the individual users, administrators, or system components that have affected your cluster. For more information, see Auditing in the Kubernetes documentation.</li> <li>Authenticator (<code>authenticator</code>) \u2013 Authenticator logs are unique to Amazon EKS.

By using this guide's solution you can enable <code>aws-for-fluent-bit</code> or <code>fargate-fluentbit</code> for logging. Fluentd is an open-source data collector for unified logging layer and written in Ruby. Fluentd acts as a unified logging layer that can aggregate data from multiple sources, unify data with different formats into JSON-formatted objects, and route them to different output destinations. Choosing a log collector is important for CPU and memory utilization when you monitor thousands of servers. If you have multiple Amazon EKS clusters, you can use Fluent Bit as a lightweight shipper to collect data from different nodes in the cluster and forward it to Fluentd for aggregation, processing and routing to a supported output destination.</p> <p>We recommend to use Fluent Bit as the log collector and forwarder to send application and cluster logs to CloudWatch. You can then stream the logs to Amazon OpenSearch Service by using a subscription filter in CloudWatch. This option is shown in this section's architecture diagram.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure: Amazon EKS application logging architecture.</p> <p>The diagram shows the following workflow when application logs from Amazon EKS clusters are streamed to Amazon OpenSearch Service. The Fluent Bit service in the Amazon EKS cluster pushes the logs to CloudWatch. The AWS Lambda function streams the logs to Amazon OpenSearch Service using a subscription filter. You can then use Kibana to visualize the logs in the configured indexes. You can also stream logs by using Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose and store them in an S3 bucket for analysis and querying with Amazon Athena.</p> <p>In most clusters, using Fluentd or Fluent Bit for log aggregation needs little optimization. This changes when you\u2019re dealing with larger clusters with thousands of pods and nodes. We have published our findings from studying the impact of Fluentd and Fluent Bit in clusters with thousands of pods. For further learning, we would recommend you to check on enhancement to Fluent Bit that is designed to reduce the volume API calls it makes to the Kubernetes API servers using Use_Kubelet option. This Fluent Bit\u2019s <code>Use_Kubelet</code> feature allows it to retrieve pod metadata from the kubelet on the host. Amazon EKS customers can use Fluent Bit to capture logs in clusters that run tens of thousands of pods with this feature enabled without overloading the Kubernetes API server.

This solution captures the <code>STDOUT</code> and <code>STDERR</code> input/output (I/O) streams from your container and sends them to CloudWatch through Fluent Bit, based on the Fluent Bit configuration established for the Amazon EKS cluster on Fargate.</p> <p>With Fluent Bit support for Amazon EKS, you no longer need to run a sidecar to route container logs from Amazon EKS pods running on Fargate. With the new built-in logging support, you can select a destination of your choice to send the records to. Amazon EKS on Fargate uses a version of Fluent Bit for AWS, an upstream conformant distribution of Fluent Bit managed by AWS.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure: Logging for Amazon EKS on Fargate.</p> <p>Please learn more about Fluent Bit support for Amazon EKS see Fargate logging in the Amazon EKS documentation.</p> <p>For some reasons, for pods running on AWS Fargate where you need to use the sidecar pattern. You can run a Fluentd (or Fluent Bit) sidecar container to capture logs produced by your applications. This option requires that the application writes logs to filesystem instead of <code>stdout</code> or <code>stderr</code>. A consequence of this approach is that you will not be able use <code>kubectl</code> logs to view container logs. To make logs appear in <code>kubectl logs</code>, you can write application logs to both <code>stdout</code> and filesystem simultaneously.</p> <p>Pods on Fargate get 20GB of ephemeral storage, which is available to all the containers that belong to a pod. You can configure your application to write logs to the local filesystem and instruct Fluentd to watch the log directory (or file). Fluentd will read events from the tail of log files and send the events to a destination like CloudWatch for storage. Ensure that you rotate logs regularly to prevent logs from usurping the entire volume.</p> <p>Please learn more about How to capture application logs when using Amazon EKS on AWS Fargate to operate and observe your kubernets applications at scale on AWS Fargate. We will also <code>tee</code> write to file and <code>stdout</code> so we see logs in <code>kubectl logs</code> in this approach.</p>"},{"location":"guides/containers/aws-native/eks/log-aggregation/#unified-log-aggregation-from-amazon-eks-and-other-compute-platforms-using-aws-native-services","title":"Unified log aggregation from Amazon EKS and other compute platforms using AWS Native services","text":"<p>Customers these days want to  unify and centralize logs across different computing platforms such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, and AWS Lambda using agents, log routers, and extensions.

However, this utilization efficiency comes at a tradeoff of increased difficulty measuring application costs. Today, you can use one of these methods to distribute costs by tenant:</p> <ul> <li>Hard multi-tenancy \u2014 Run separate EKS clusters in dedicated AWS accounts.</li> <li>Soft multi-tenancy \u2014 Run multiple node groups in a shared EKS cluster.</li> <li>Consumption based billing \u2014 Use resource consumption to calculate the cost incurred in a shared EKS cluster.</li> </ul> <p>With Hard multi-tenancy, workloads get deployed in separate EKS clusters and you can identify the cost incurred for the cluster and its dependencies without having to run reports to determine each tenant\u2019s spend. With Soft multi-tenancy, you can use Kubernetes features like Node Selectors and Node Affinity to instruct Kubernetes Scheduler to run a tenant\u2019s workload on dedicated node groups. You can tag the EC2 instances in a node group with an identifier (like product name or team name) and use tags to distribute costs. A downside of the above two approach is that you may end up with unused capacity and may not fully utilize the cost savings that come when you run a densely packed cluster. You still need ways to allocate cost of shared resources like Elastic Load Balancing, network transfer charges.</p> <p>The most efficient way to track costs in multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters is to distribute incurred costs based on the amount of resources consumed by workloads. This pattern allows you to maximize the utilization of your EC2 instances because different workloads can share nodes, which allows you to increase the pod-density on your nodes. However, calculating costs by workload or namespaces is a challenging task. Understanding the cost-responsibility of a workload requires aggregating all the resources consumed or reserved during a time-frame, and evaluating the charges based on the cost of the resource and the duration of the usage.

The default values for these parameters are based on the marginal resource rates of the cloud provider, but they can be customized within Kubecost.

In this post, I will walk you through configuring Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to work with Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus Alert Manager. This approach lets you move a Prometheus-based workload to the cloud while taking advantage of services like autoscaling.</p> <p>Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus provides support for alerting rules that use PromQL. The Prometheus alerting rules documentation provides the syntax and examples of valid alerting rules. Likewise, the Prometheus alert manager documentation references both the syntax and examples of valid alert manager configurations.</p>"},{"location":"recipes/recipes/as-ec2-using-amp-and-alertmanager/#solution-overview","title":"Solution overview","text":"<p>First, let\u2019s briefly review Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling\u2018s concept of an Auto Scaling group which is a logical collection of Amazon EC2 instances. An Auto Scaling group can launch EC2 instances based on a predefined launch template. The launch template contains information used to launch the Amazon EC2 instance, including the AMI ID, the instance type, network settings, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) instance profile.</p> <p>Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups have a minimum size, maximum size, and desired capacity concepts. When Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling detects that the current running capacity of the Auto Scaling group is above or below the desired capacity, it will automatically scale out or scale in as needed. This scaling approach lets you utilize elasticity within your workload while still keeping bounds on both capacity and costs.</p> <p>To demonstrate this solution, I have created an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group that contains two Amazon EC2 instances. These instances remote write instance metrics to an Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace. I have set the Auto Scaling group\u2019s minimum size to two (to maintain high availability), and I\u2019ve set the group\u2019s maximum size to 10 (to help control costs). As more traffic hits the solution, additional Amazon EC2 instances are automatically added to support the load, up to the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group\u2019s maximum size. As the load decreases, those Amazon EC2 instances are terminated until the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group reaches the group\u2019s minimum size. This approach lets you have a performant application by utilizing the elasticity of the cloud.</p> <p>Note that as you scrape more and more resources, you could quickly overwhelm the capabilities of a single Prometheus server. You can avoid this situation by scaling Prometheus servers linearly with the workload. This approach ensures that you can collect metric data at the granularity that you want.</p> <p>To support the Auto Scaling of a Prometheus workload, I have created an Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus workspace with the following rules:</p> <p><code>YAML</code> <pre><code>groups:\n- name: example\n  rules:\n  - alert: HostHighCpuLoad\n    expr: 100 - (avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode=\"idle\"}[2m])) * 100) &gt; 60\n    for: 5m\n    labels:\n      severity: warning\n      event_type: scale_up\n    annotations:\n      summary: Host high CPU load (instance {{ $labels.instance }})\n      description: \"CPU load is &gt; 60%\\n  VALUE = {{ $value }}\\n  LABELS = {{ $labels }}\"\n  - alert: HostLowCpuLoad\n    expr: 100 - (avg(rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode=\"idle\"}[2m])) * 100) &lt; 30\n    for: 5m\n    labels:\n      severity: warning\n      event_type: scale_down\n    annotations:\n      summary: Host low CPU load (instance {{ $labels.instance }})\n      description: \"CPU load is &lt; 30%\\n  VALUE = {{ $value }}\\n  LABELS = {{ $labels }}\"\n</code></pre></p> <p>This rules set creates a <code>HostHighCpuLoad</code> and a <code>HostLowCpuLoad</code> rules. These alerts trigger when the CPU is greater than 60% or less than 30% utilization over a five-minute period.</p> <p>After raising an alert, the alert manager will forward the message into an Amazon SNS topic, passing an <code>alert_type</code> (the alert name) and <code>event_type</code> (scale_down or scale_up).</p> <p><code>YAML</code> <pre><code>alertmanager_config: |\n  route: \n    receiver: default_receiver\n    repeat_interval: 5m\n\n  receivers:\n    - name: default_receiver\n      sns_configs:\n        - topic_arn: &lt;ARN OF SNS TOPIC GOES HERE&gt;\n          send_resolved: false\n          sigv4:\n            region: us-east-1\n          message: |\n            alert_type: {{ .CommonLabels.alertname }}\n            event_type: {{ .CommonLabels.event_type }}\n</code></pre></p> <p>An AWS Lambda function is subscribed to the Amazon SNS topic. I have written logic in the Lambda function to inspect the Amazon SNS message and determine if a <code>scale_up</code> or <code>scale_down</code> event should happen. Then, the Lambda function increments or decrements the desired capacity of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. The Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group detects a requested change in capacity, and then invokes or deallocates Amazon EC2 instances.</p> <p>The Lambda code to support Auto Scaling is as follows:</p> <p><code>Python</code> <pre><code>import json\nimport boto3\nimport os\n\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n    print(event)\n    msg = event['Records'][0]['Sns']['Message']\n\n    scale_type = ''\n    if msg.find('scale_up') &gt; -1:\n        scale_type = 'scale_up'\n    else:\n        scale_type = 'scale_down'\n\n    get_desired_instance_count(scale_type)\n\ndef get_desired_instance_count(scale_type):\n\n    client = boto3.client('autoscaling')\n    asg_name = os.environ['ASG_NAME']\n    response = client.describe_auto_scaling_groups(AutoScalingGroupNames=[ asg_name])\n\n    minSize = response['AutoScalingGroups'][0]['MinSize']\n    maxSize = response['AutoScalingGroups'][0]['MaxSize']\n    desiredCapacity = response['AutoScalingGroups'][0]['DesiredCapacity']\n\n    if scale_type == \"scale_up\":\n        desiredCapacity = min(desiredCapacity+1, maxSize)\n    if scale_type == \"scale_down\":\n        desiredCapacity = max(desiredCapacity - 1, minSize)\n\n    print('Scale type: {}; new capacity: {}'.format(scale_type, desiredCapacity))\n    response = client.set_desired_capacity(AutoScalingGroupName=asg_name, DesiredCapacity=desiredCapacity, HonorCooldown=False)\n</code></pre></p> <p>The full architecture can be reviewed in the following figure.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"recipes/recipes/as-ec2-using-amp-and-alertmanager/#testing-out-the-solution","title":"Testing out the solution","text":"<p>You can launch an AWS CloudFormation template to automatically provision this solution.</p> <p>Stack prerequisites:</p> <ul> <li>An Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)</li> <li>An AWS Security Group that allows outbound traffic</li> </ul> <p>Select the Download Launch Stack Template link to download and set up the template in your account.

For our purposes we consider logs to be a fundamentally different signal from traces, which are composed of events from more than one application or a service, and with context about the connection between services such as response latency, service faults, request parameters etc.</p> <p>Data in logs can also be aggregate over a period of time. For example, they may be statistical (e.g. number of requests served over the previous minute). They can be structured, free-form, verbose, and in any written language. </p> <p>The primary use cases for logging are describing,</p> <ul> <li>an event, including its status and duration, and other vital statistics</li> <li>errors or warnings related to that event (e.g. stack traces, timeouts)</li> <li>application launches, start-up and shutdown messages</li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>Logs are intended to be immutable, and many log management systems include mechanisms to protect against, and detect attempts, to modify log data. </p> <p>Regardless of your requirements for logging, these are the best practices that we have identified. </p>"},{"location":"signals/logs/#structured-logging-is-key-to-success","title":"Structured logging is key to success","text":"<p>Many systems will emit logs in a semi-structured format.

Additionally, it can make recommendations to you based on your selected hosting region and use of CloudFront as a Content Delivery Network<sup>1</sup>.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Internet Monitor only evaluates traffic from networks that your workloads traverse.
